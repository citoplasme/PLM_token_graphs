Ohsumed,3419,test,"Reduction of cardiovascular disease-related mortality among postmenopausal women who use hormones: evidence from a national cohort.  A national sample of 1944 white menopausal women greater than or equal to 55 years old from the epidemiologic follow-up of participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey was reviewed to investigate the role of hormone therapy in altering the risk of death from cardiovascular disease.  Women in the study were observed for up to 16 years after the baseline survey in 1971 to 1975.  By 1987 631 women had died; 347 of these deaths were due to cardiovascular disease.  History of diabetes (relative risk, 2.38; 95% confidence interval 1.73 to 3.26), previous myocardial infarction (relative risk, 2.12; 95% confidence interval 1.56 to 2.86), smoking (relative risk, 2.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.69 to 2.81), and elevated blood pressure (relative risk, 1.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.14 to 1.94) were strong predictors of cardiovascular disease-related death in this cohort.  After adjusting for known cardiovascular disease risk factors (smoking, cholesterol, body mass index, blood pressure, previous myocardial infarction, history of diabetes, age) and education, the use of postmenopausal hormones was associated with a reduced risk of death from cardiovascular disease (relative risk, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.48 to 0.90).  The same protective effect provided by postmenopausal hormone therapy was seen in women who experienced natural menopause (relative risk, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.45 to 1.06)."
Ohsumed,407,validation,"Wounding effects of the AK-47 rifle used by Patrick Purdy in the Stockton, California, schoolyard shooting of January 17, 1989.  The limited disruption produced in tissue simulant by the rifle and bullets used in the Stockton, California, schoolyard shooting is entirely consistent with the autopsy reports on the five children who died of their wounds.  It is also entirely consistent with well-documented battlefield studies and with previous tissue-simulant studies from many laboratories.  It is inconsistent with many exaggerated accounts of assault-rifle wounding effects described by the media in the aftermath of this incident.  This information should be documented for the historical record.  However, the critical reason for correcting the misconceptions produced by media reaction to this incident is to prevent inappropriate gunshot-wound treatment."
Ohsumed,1146,test,"Small-volume resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock in dogs: effects on systemic hemodynamics and systemic blood flow.  BACKGROUND AND METHODS: This study compared canine systemic hemodynamics and organ blood flow (radioactive microsphere technique) after resuscitation with 0.8% saline (Na+ 137 mEq/L), 7.2% hypertonic saline (Na+ 1233 mEq/L), 20% hydroxyethyl starch in 0.8% saline, or 20% hydroxyethyl starch in 7.2% saline, each in a volume approximating 15% of shed blood volume.  Twenty-four endotracheally intubated mongrel dogs (18 to 24 kg) underwent a 30-min period of hemorrhagic shock, from time 0 to 30 min into the shock period, followed by fluid resuscitation.  Data were collected at baseline, 15 min into the shock period, immediately after fluid infusion, 5 min after the beginning of resuscitation, and at 60-min intervals for 2 hr, (65 min after the beginning of resuscitation, and 125 min after the beginning of resuscitation).  The animals received one of four randomly assigned iv resuscitation fluids: saline (54 mL/kg), hypertonic saline (6.0 mL/kg), hydroxyethel starch (6.0 mL/kg) or hypertonic saline/hydroxyethyl starch (6.0 mL/kg).  RESULTS: Mean arterial pressure increased in all groups after resuscitation.  Cardiac output increased with resuscitation in all groups, exceeding baseline in the saline and hypertonic saline/hydroxyethyl starch groups (p less than .05 compared with hypertonic saline or hydroxyethyl starch).  Sixty-five minutes after the beginning of resuscitation, cardiac output was significantly (p less than .05) greater in either of the two colloid-containing groups than in the hypertonic saline group.  After resuscitation, hypertonic saline and hydroxyethyl starch produced minimal improvements in hepatic arterial flow, hypertonic saline/hydroxyethyl starch increased hepatic arterial flow to near baseline levels, and saline markedly increased hepatic arterial flow to levels exceeding baseline (p less than .05, saline vs.  hydroxyethyl starch).  One hundred twenty-five minutes after the beginning of resuscitation, hepatic arterial flow had decreased in all groups; hepatic arterial flow in the hypertonic saline group had decreased to levels comparable with those during shock.  Myocardial, renal, and brain blood flow were not significantly different between groups.  CONCLUSIONS: Small-volume resuscitation with the combination of hypertonic saline/hydroxyethyl starch is comparable with much larger volumes of 0.8% saline, and is equal to hypertonic saline or hydroxyethyl starch in the ability to restore and sustain BP and improve organ blood flow after resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock."
IMDb-top_1000,1,test,"Ignore the extreme votes about ""House of Wax"", in no way is it either a ""1"" or a ""10"". I will try to be of help to anyone thinking about seeing ""House of Wax"" or for those who saw it based on the trailer and feel cheated. The trailer makes this movie look very promising, which is what trailers are supposed to do. There is only one thing for sure with trailers, if the producers can't cobble together a minute of interesting elements to make a trailer, it is a pretty much a sure thing that the movie is a major suck-fest. But a good trailer only tells you that a few things about the movie are good, it does not give you much idea about the total package. Here a little research can be valuable. <br /><br />""House of Wax"" stars Elisha Cuthbert (whose acting skills are closer to Kathy Ireland than to either her fellow Canadian Sarah Polley or her lookalike Rose McGowen), and was directed by a music video artist formerly known as Jaume, in his feature debut. These are not good signs but if you are like me you ignore them and go to see the work of Production Designer Grace Walken, who was responsible for the look of ""Ghost Ship"". Once again Walken's work is worth seeing, so much so that it looks like 90% of the movie's $30 million budget went to production design. The rest went to Cuthbert to compensate her for the abuse she has to take throughout the film (finger cut off, lips glued shut, tied up, and lots of wading around in assorted gooey stuff). By-the-bye, Cuthbert looks considerably heavier than she did in ""The Girl Next Door"", about one big pig-out away from having a major weight problem.<br /><br />Which means they had little left over to pay the rest of the cast and crew. And judging from the what was on the screen, this might actually be true. It looks like everyone else donated their time to get their first acting or crew credit. Unfortunately, whether it was inexperience or jealousy over the pay disparity, the contributions of all these inexperienced/incompetent volunteers amount to less than zero.<br /><br />Inexperienced Steven Window's DP work was about as awful as you are likely to see and working in league with an incompetent editor like Joel Negran (insert ""Pearl Harbor"" here) they manage to take away most of the value added by the production design group. Rather than linger over and showcase the sets, Window filmed this stuff with bad lighting and jerky-zooming-bobbing camera work. Negran compounded the problem with an insane number of disorienting cuts. Poor lighting, an ADD-like camera, and flurry cutting are what you use to hide cheap and crappy production design; not what is needed when the movie's only strength is its expensive and detailed sets.<br /><br />Chan Hayes did the screenplay and Charles Belden (who wrote the original story) is credited as the writer although except for the title and the use of wax figures there is absolutely no similarity. One saving grace is that the movie does not take itself seriously as a horror film and is mostly parody (insert ""Van Helsing"" here). The murders are played for laughs, too extreme to be scary or even creepy to anyone over age six. The audience particularly cracked up when a certain high profile hotel heiress got her homely face run through by an steel bar, although her earlier half-baked striptease was the only genuinely creepy thing in the film. Another comedy highlight was when Cuthbert sticks her finger through a grate and has it clipped off by the bad guy.<br /><br />The good scenes take place in Trudy's House of Wax, a waxworks that has something to do with a closed sugar mill, conjoined twins, and a lot of roadkill (which Cuthbert gets to bathe in). All this is supposed to be happening somewhere in rural Florida although from the many hills it sure looks like Paul Hogan's country (attention location scouts-the gulf coast is not noted for it's rolling terrain). The screenplay apparently intended to play up the connection (bad pun) between the two sets of twins, but somewhere during production or post-production most of the dialogue concerning this was trimmed. Since what is left about the twin connection makes no sense and goes nowhere, you wonder why it wasn't also cut to reduce the boredom factor.<br /><br />What is particularly sad is that the producers did not have the brains to recognize in mid-production that they had the ingredients for a first rate horror classic-even with the existing cast. What was staring them in the face was a chance to go somewhere with the illusion of a town of wax. Because it is a photographic medium, modern film is intrinsically naturalistic, almost without exception prone to creating an illusion of reality. Here they had a ready-made opportunity to give the photographic medium a theatrical element of extreme stylization. Like an impressionist painting, the town creates the illusion of reality from a distance but reveals itself as a highly stylized wax fabrication up close. Of course they would have had to find a visionary Director and DP to bring the thing off successfully, but everything else was already in place for this to happen."
Ohsumed,1828,test,"Deep femoral lymphadenectomy with preservation of the fascia lata. Preliminary report on 42 invasive vulvar carcinomas.  Forty-two patients with primary invasive vulvar carcinoma were treated with radical vulvectomy and deep femoral lymphadenectomy with preservation of the fascia lata and cribriform fascia.  The rationale for using this technique was based on anatomic knowledge of the topographic distribution of groin lymph nodes, which was confirmed by the study of 50 cadavers.  The preliminary data show that the number of superficial and deep femoral lymph nodes removed from the 42 patients (mean number of nodes, 20; range, 8-32) was similar to the number reported in anatomy books.  In addition, the five-year actuarial survival rate, 70%, was comparable to that in the literature.  These preliminary results suggest that the surgical technique used in this study is as radical an oncologic procedure as Way's classic groin lymphadenectomy, which consists of removing the fascia lata and cribriform fascia."

Ohsumed,1966,test,"Preprandial blood glucose values and glycemic responses in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus at constant insulinemia.  The influence of preprandial blood glucose (PPBG) concentration on glycemic responses was studied in seven subjects with insulin-dependent diabetes who, by means of the artificial pancreas, had achieved PPBG concentrations of 6, 9, and 17 mmol/L.  A test meal of 50 g parboiled rice was given at the three different occasions and a constant insulin infusion was provided during the observation periods.  The mean postprandial-blood-glucose-response area (above basal) differed significantly at the three blood glucose concentrations of 6, 9, and 17 mmol/L, reaching 1371, 621, and 179 mmol/L x 240 min, respectively (P less than 0.01).  A negative correlation between the PPBG concentrations and the glycemic responses to the test meal was found (r = 0.94; P less than 0.001).  The fasting insulin concentration at a PPBG concentration of 17 mmol/L was lower than at a PPBG concentration of 6 and 9 mmol/L.  In conclusion, the glycemic responses to a carbohydrate meal are inversely correlated to the PPBG concentration in insulin-dependent diabetic subjects."

Ohsumed,1952,test,"Immediate reproducibility of electrically induced sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia before and during antiarrhythmic therapy   The immediate reproducibility of sustained ventricular tachycardia induction was evaluated prospectively during 106 studies performed in 53 patients with clinical sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.  Programmed electrical stimulation was performed twice, using the same protocol during 53 drug-free studies and 53 subsequent studies on antiarrhythmic therapy.  Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was reproduced in 104 (98%) of the 106 studies.  There was no significant difference in the incidence of reproducible tachycardia in the drug-free state compared with that observed during treatment with different classes of antiarrhythmic drugs.  An increase in the number of extrastimuli was required to reinitiate the tachycardia in 9 (11%) of 83 studies in which single or double extrastimuli were initially required to induce the tachycardia.  In 39 (37%) of 104 studies with reproducible tachycardia induction, the two tachycardias significantly differed in electrocardiographic (ECG) configuration and cycle length.  These observations suggest that the overall reproducibility of ventricular tachycardia induction is sufficiently high to provide a reliable marker for evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic interventions.  However, specific tachycardia characteristics such as cycle length and ECG configuration are more variable even within the same study and may be less useful in assessing the effects of subsequent interventions."

Ohsumed,675,test,"Vegetables, fruits, and carotenoids and the risk of cancer.  Low intake of vegetables, fruits, and carotenoids is consistently associated with increased risk of lung cancer in both prospective and retrospective studies.  In addition, low levels of beta-carotene in serum or plasma are consistently associated with the subsequent development of lung cancer.  The simplest explanation is that beta-carotene is protective.  Since retinol (preformed vitamin A) is not related in a similar manner to lung cancer risk, beta-carotene appears to function through a mechanism that does not require conversion into vitamin A.  However, the importance of other carotenoids and other constituents of vegetables and fruit has not been adequately explored.  Both prospective and retrospective studies suggest that vegetable and fruit intake may reduce the risk of cancers of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, bladder, and cervix.  But because of fewer studies and less consistency among studies, the epidemiologic evidence is at present less persuasive than for lung cancer."

Ohsumed,3630,test,"Ligamentous laxity across C0-C1-C2 complex. Axial torque-rotation characteristics until failure.  The axial torque until failure of the ligamentous occipito-atlanto-axial complex (C0-C1-C2) subjected to axial angular rotation (theta) was characterized using a biaxial MTS system.  A special fixture and gearbox that permitted right axial rotation of the specimen until failure without imposing any additional constraints were designed to obtain the data.  The average values for the axial rotation and torque at the point of maximum resistance were, respectively, 68.1 degrees and 13.6 N-m.  The specimens offered minimal resistance (approximately 0.5 N-m), up to an average axial rotation of 21 degrees across the complex.  The torque-angular rotation (T-theta) curve can be divided into four regions: regions of least and steadily increasing resistances, a transition zone that connects these two regions, and the increasing resistance region to the point of maximum resistance.  The regions of least and steadily increasing resistances may be represented by two straight lines with average slopes of 0.028 and 0.383 N-m/degree, respectively.  Post-test dissection of the specimens disclosed the following.  The point of maximum resistance corresponded roughly to the value of axial rotation at which complete bilateral rotary dislocation of the C1-C2 facets occurred.  The types of injuries observed were related to the magnitude of axial rotation imposed on a specimen during testing.  Soft-tissue injuries alone (like stretch/rupture of the capsular ligaments, subluxation of the C1-C2 facets, etc.) were confined to specimens rotated up to or close to the point of maximum resistance.  The specimens that were subjected to rotations up to the point of maximum resistance of the curve spontaneously reduced completely on removal from the testing apparatus.  Spontaneous reduction was not possible for specimens tested slightly beyond their points of maximum resistance."

Ascorbic acid deficiency in guinea pigs fed a vitamin D-replete diet caused a moderate reduction of Ca level in serum and bone; 25-hydroxy-cholecalciferol or 25-hydroxyergocalciferol (25-OHD) serum concentration tended to decline; renal 25-hydroxycholecalciferol-1-hydroxylase (1-OHase) activity decreased 50%; and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol-24-hydroxylase activity increased 1.6-fold.  Chromatin 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [1,25-(OH)2D3] receptor concentration in the intestinal mucosa decreased 20-30%, and the percentage of occupied receptors decreased from 12-15% to 6-8%.  Receptor affinity for 1,25-(OH)2D3 did not change (Kd = 0.24-0.26 nmol/L, Kd2 = 0.06-0.10 nmol/L), but the cooperativity coefficient decreased from 1.7 to 1.4.  Vitamin C deficiency potentiated effects of vitamin D deprivation and impaired a restorative action of vitamin D.  It was accompanied by a marked delay in the elevation of 25-OHD concentration in serum as well as decreased 1-OHase activity in kidneys and a lower concentration of occupied 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors in the intestinal mucosa.  The data demonstrate a critical role for ascorbic acid in vitamin D metabolism and binding."

Several previous studies that looked at the effects of labeling individuals as hypertensive found increases in psychosocial distress, diminished feelings of well-being, or absenteeism.  Other studies found no such effects.  Thus far, similar studies relating to labeling for high blood cholesterol levels have not been published.  The Massachusetts Model Systems for Blood Cholesterol Screening Project investigated whether labeling effects occurred as a result of the community-based screening, education, and referral programs it conducted in Worcester and Lowell.  Nine questions concerning perceptions of physical and psychological well-being were asked on a questionnaire given to screening participants.  The same questions were asked as part of a follow-up questionnaire given to all individuals identified as having high blood cholesterol levels at one of the screenings.  Comparison of the baseline and follow-up results did not demonstrate significant overall negative effects among any age, sex, racial, income, or educational groups.  On the contrary, responses to many of the questions revealed small but statistically significant improvements in perceptions of physical and psychological well-being.

Studies have been reviewed, using methodologic standards for the critical appraisal of studies on prognosis, developed by Sackett and colleagues in the Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics at McMaster University (Hamilton, Ontario, Canada).  Few of the studies investigating psychosocial adjustment of women with breast cancer meet all of the criteria for reviewing studies of clinical course and prognosis.  This review focuses the direction and methodologic rigor required in future investigations.  In particular, studies are needed that employ prospective designs and that deliberately measure or control for the extraneous prognostic variables that may affect adjustment.  Future investigations need to incorporate adequate precision in measurement so that measures of the psychosocial variables are objective, reliable, and valid."

Ohsumed,3715,test,"Hirudin interruption of heparin-resistant arterial thrombus formation in baboons.  To determine the role of thrombin in high blood flow, platelet-dependent thrombotic and hemostatic processes we measured the relative antithrombotic and antihemostatic effects in baboons of hirudin, a highly potent and specific antithrombin, and compared the effects of heparin, an antithrombin III-dependent inhibitor of thrombin.  Thrombus formation was determined in vivo using three relevant models (homologous endarterectomized aorta, collagen-coated tubing, and Dacron vascular graft) by measuring: (1) platelet deposition, using gamma camera imaging of 111In-platelets; (2) fibrin deposition, as assessed by the incorporation of circulating 125I-fibrinogen; and (3) occlusion.  The continuous intravenous infusion of 1, 5, and 20 nmol/kg per minute of recombinant hirudin (desulfatohirudin) maintained constant plasma levels of 0.16 +/- 0.03, 0.79 +/- 0.44, and 3.3 +/- 0.77 mumol/mL, respectively.  Hirudin interrupted platelet and fibrin deposition in a dose-dependent manner that was profound at the highest dose for all three thrombogenic surfaces and significant at the lowest dose for thrombus formation on endarterectomized aorta.  Thrombotic occlusion was prevented by all doses studied.  In contrast, heparin did not inhibit either platelet or fibrin deposition when administered at a dose that maximally prolonged clotting times (100 U/kg) (P greater than .1), and only intermediate effects were produced at 10-fold that dose (1,000 U/kg).  Moreover, heparin did not prevent occlusion of the test segments.  Hirudin inhibited platelet hemostatic function in concert with its antithrombotic effects (bleeding times were prolonged by the intermediate and higher doses).  By comparison, intravenous heparin failed to affect the bleeding time at the 100 U/kg dose (P greater than .5), and only minimally prolonged the bleeding time at the 1,000 U/kg dose (P less than .05).  We conclude that platelet-dependent thrombotic and hemostatic processes are thrombin-mediated and that the biologic antithrombin hirudin produces a potent, dose-dependent inhibition of arterial thrombus formation that greatly exceeds the minimal antithrombotic effects produced by heparin."
IMDb-top_1000,3,test,"I don't know how I would feel if I lived in USA. I would watch some preview scenes, advertisements, I would know, Sidney Pollack directed it, Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas starring in. I would watch this film as soon as possible without reading any bad review. Would I be disappointment?<br /><br />I read a lot of review which is said how bad this film was: This is boring, long film without passion emotions and it is not interesting. Harrison is wooden, cold. The sublots should be cut. Too serious, particularly for Harrison Ford. I am interested in the subject, and I like Harrison Ford in the films which are not actions. I like Sidney Pollack and Kristin Scott Thomas too. So reading the reviews on IMDB website then in other sites then in February in the Hungarian movie magazines I was wonder and wonder what the film was. Anyway there are films, directors, stars what/who I want to see despite any reviews.<br /><br />I can understand people who thinks this film is boring and cold and has got not any passion, but I feel different. It is true I liked Sliding Doors, The Forbidden Woman (this is a French film, I don't know what its title in English, or in French). Basic of these films is development of a love.<br /><br />I think Random Heart is a nice and interesting film in its own way.<br /><br />It may be true that the sublots -the congress election and the cop's investigation after a corrupt policeman- are not written well, are not worked out in details but add something to the leading woman and man character.After his wife's death and betrayal emotion, angry of Dutch comes to the surface during his work. He will be suspicious and almost lost his best friend (then the woman too). The film shows two ways to survive the tragedy: our wife/husband's death and cheating. One of them is the woman's: this is tragedy, but the life is continuing. She doesn't want to mourn forever. What she wants to know-what her husband's lover-the cop's wife- thought about her she will not learn never. She is forced to behave in this way. The elections are comes, and anything about his husband may become scandal. She wants her daughter not to be disappointment with her father. The man is a cop.He suffering from the fact he lived in lies. He wants to know -maybe every men would want to know in this situation-when his wife started to cheat him. How long had she got lover?. He needs the woman's help but she doesn't want, but the guy is stubborn and steady/persistent. The woman can't stand him because he always steps into her life and she cannot forget. Their relationship is tense at the beginning then slowly developments a type of silent sympathy which is prefer an alliance against the outside world, the tragedy. (I said it in spite of that they made love in bed) However the cop, can't stop with investigation, can't stop close and can't allow the woman close to him but he starts the ""love"", and the woman wants their relationship to continue. But it can't. The woman realizes it. The end is a bit sad, but logic, and nice at the same time.<br /><br />It was pleasant for me to see again Peter Coyote-I like this man's face- Sidney Pollack. I hardly knew Bonnie Hunt but she was good.<br /><br />I think Harrison Ford did an okay job. His eardrop is unusual but at the beginning then finally I believed that the woman liked being at his company in spite of his temperament. It was pity he had not got any joke. But Ford has got a good sense of humour. A reviewer noticed (in Hungary): ""Ford is charismatic against his haircut and ear drop and we are waiting for his presence and would like him to smile at us and make an ironic notice. But Dr Jones is not smiling at us"".. But he smiles at the end and it is soooo good. With the rest I agree. I very like him in this role- He is good in acting of this a bit rough, cool but somewhere in his soul smart cop.. The character of Kristin Scott Thomas is a woman who is determined, self confident, but she is closed inside a ivory tower and she keeps aloof from her emotions. But she is a really woman who become indecisive and find support on the cop.The two cool, reserved- people find each other.<br /><br />Maybe the script is not good. It is full of common, banal sentence, but there are some humorous sentences from the woman and movement particularly from the man. It is a good film but not for everybody, not for the general big audience. I watched the females under 18 and males above 45 liked this film better. About the latter, maybe Sidney Pollack made this film for his age-group which doesn't go to multiplex. Anyway I advice the people who like energetic plots with action scenes, who like only Ford's action films miss this movie."
Ohsumed,333,validation,"The changing epidemiology of diabetes mellitus among Navajo Indians.  Although early descriptions of diabetes mellitus among Navajo Indians characterized the disease as an infrequent and ""benign chemical abnormality,"" the prevalence of diabetes and its complications among Navajos appears to have increased substantially in this century.  We reviewed recent Indian Health Service inpatient and ambulatory care data and compared these data with previous reports.  Of the estimated Navajo population aged 45 years or older, 4,331 (16.9%) had an ambulatory care visit for diabetes between October 1, 1986, and September 30, 1987.  Diabetes was coded for 1,041 (7.0%) of hospital admissions of persons aged 20 and older.  Of 377 lower-extremity amputations done from 1978 to 1987, diabetes was involved in 245 (66%).  The 1986 age-adjusted mortality rate from diabetes was 30.3 per 100,000, approximately twice that for the general US population.  The explanation for the increased prevalence of diabetes mellitus among Navajos probably relates to an increasing prevalence of obesity."

From 1962 to 1988, 50 of 801 patients with adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum treated at the National Naval Medical Center were less than 40 years old.  Symptoms were present in 47 of the younger patients at presentation.  The mean duration of time from the onset of symptoms to diagnosis in this group was 4.9 months.  Risk factors for carcinoma of the colon and rectum were identified in 14 of 50 patients less than 40 years old.  A significantly greater proportion of patients less than 40 years old had Stage C disease compared with the older group of patients (42 versus 22 per cent, p = 0.014).  Stage B disease was more common in patients more than 40 years of age (44.8 versus 26.0 per cent, p = 0.014).  The proportion of patients with Stages A and D disease was similar in both age groups.  The cumulative survival rate in this group at five and ten years was 43 and 34 per cent, respectively.  The five year survival rate in patients less than 40 years old with Stage B disease was 76 per cent and with Stage C disease, 37 per cent.  All young patients with Stage D disease were dead at 28 months.  Synchronous and metachronous carcinomas of the colon and rectum were uncommon in patients less than 40 years old.  Patients less than 40 years of age with carcinoma of the colon and rectum are usually symptomatic and have advanced disease at the time of presentation.  Survival time for these patients for each stage of disease is similar to the over-all population of patients with carcinoma of the colon and rectum."

Ohsumed,59,test,"The leukocyte count: a predictor of hypertension.  In an exploratory study of 1031 persons observed to progress from normotension to essential hypertension and 1031 matched subjects who remained normotensive, the initial leukocyte count (WBC) was found to be related to the development of hypertension, with risk increased 40% (95% confidence interval 12-82%) in persons in the highest as compared to the lowest quartile of WBC.  This relationship proved to be largely independent of body mass index, body fat distribution, alcohol and tobacco consumption, and parental history of hypertension.  An increased WBC may reflect greater sympathetic tone or may directly increase peripheral vascular resistance by impeding circulation through small blood vessels.  If confirmed, this study adds another condition to the growing list for which the WBC is predictive.  This simple, cheap test should be considered for inclusion in prospective epidemiological studies of many different diseases."

Ohsumed,3439,test,"Prenatal diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis.  Prenatal diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis was attempted in 50 pregnant women at risk for giving birth to an affected child.  Fifteen of these patients seroconverted during pregnancy and 35 had a high initial antibody level in their first serum sample.  Prenatal diagnosis consisted of a combination of ultrasound screening, amniocentesis, and funipuncture at about 20 weeks' gestation.  Diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis was based on a positive toxoplasma culture of amniotic fluid or fetal blood and on the presence of specific immunoglobulin M antibodies in fetal blood.  In addition, alterations in fetal hematology, cellular immunology, and fetal liver tests were indicative of infection.  Fetal infection was detected in six fetuses; two died in utero as a consequence of the infection and four were born after 37 weeks' gestation.  Despite antibiotic treatment with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine, one child has internal hydrocephalus and chorioretinitis and another has unilateral chorioretinitis.  In the two other children, the disease is still subclinical.  Of the 44 children born after a negative prenatal diagnosis, 35 have reached the age of 1 year; toxoplasma antibodies have disappeared in all of them.  Investigation of the remaining nine children showed a decrease in toxoplasma antibodies, suggesting that none of them are affected.  Prenatal diagnosis was never associated with fetal loss, and premature delivery occurred in only two cases.  We conclude that prenatal diagnosis of congenital toxoplasmosis is safe and reliable."

Although some children had abnormal values, the group maintained a normal mean total lung capacity and functional residual capacity.  The mean residual volume and the residual volume/total lung capacity ratios were elevated at both ages.  At age 7 years the 19 patients (59%) who had a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of less than 80% had ""catch up"" improvement by 10 years of age (65 +/- 11% to 72 +/- 16% of predicted value; p less than 0.05).  All the children who had a normal FEV1 at 7 years of age continued to have a normal FEV1 at age 10 years.  Resting single-breath carbon monoxide uptake by the lung was normal when measured at age 10 years.  The majority of patients had a positive methacholine challenge test result at both ages, although there was a low incidence of clinically diagnosed asthma.  This study demonstrates that patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia who have normal lung function at age 7 have had normal lung growth and that those with evidence of mild to moderate lung disease have continued lung growth or repair, or both, during their school years."

IMDb-top_1000,298,test,"Significant Spoilers! <br /><br />This is a sick, disturbing movie... just like the sick, twisted director, Jennifer Chambers Lynch who also wrote it. I don't even know why I gave this movie a rating of 2. It is not the fault of the actors for sure. The cast certainly portrayed their roles well. It is the way this movie was written and the way the characters were written which was the benchmark of a truly sick mind.<br /><br />I do know that I will never, ever watch another movie which has been written or directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch. She is a sick, twisted, foul-mouthed, foul-thinking deviant. She looks, speaks and sounds like some biker chick with her brain fried on drugs, who spent 20 years doing hard time. You can clearly see what kind of person she is by watching her on the DVD special features section of ""Surveillance: The Watched are Watching."" You can see and hear her for yourself. She was every bit as bad as I had envisioned from the writing of this movie.<br /><br />I'm not shocked by bad language, although this director certainly talks like a sailor. This goes far beyond simple bad language; worse than any p0rn film. The level of implied sado-violence and perversion she incorporates into every character she writes are of the genre which is even illegal by p0rn standards. This perverse, disturbing thinking is clearly apparent in her own personality and things she says. Another reviewer found the description I was seeking. This is a snuff film.<br /><br />Be sure to listen to her narration on the deleted scenes and alternate ending. This director/writer is truly a sick person. I can't believe anyone would put her in charge of a movie, much less pay her for it. You can be assured that I will never, ever watch another movie she has been affiliated with. In the thousands of movies I have watched and collected, there are only a couple directors and writers which have merited this kind of boycott. She is offensive beyond anyone I have ever seen connected with filming a movie before. There have been some bad directors and writers, but none could compare to her sick, twisted mind.<br /><br />When I saw this movie, which was just one murder rampage after another. Once it got past the hotel murder... then the sick cops shooting at and brutalizing drivers for kicks... the vacation family with the bad parents (who had no business being in the presence of children)... followed by the drug addicts.... the movie then proceeded to the (even more) twisted, deviant serial killers.<br /><br />As I saw the serial killers reveal themselves, I began to wonder what kind of truly sick mind wrote this movie. Those were my actual thoughts as I watched this movie. I fully intended to find out what writer had such a sick mind... because that writer seriously needs to be committed for long-term psychiatric treatment. To my surprise, it turned out to be the director. When I saw and heard what she had to say on the DVD, I realized my assessment of the writer was right on the nose. On the DVD, she was indeed the sick, twisted person I had envisioned writing such a disturbing film.<br /><br />While the little girl, (Stephanie) Ryan Simpkins, truly stole the show... I can't believe that her real-life parents would have tolerated this sick, foul-mouthed, director to be anywhere near their daughter.<br /><br />This movie is disturbing, sick, offensive, twisted and the director-writer needs some serious treatment in a mental facility.<br /><br />As far as the ending of the movie goes... the alternate ending, should have been the outcome of this horrific ordeal. There was no point and no benefit to the film or the story or the flow of the film by the death of the other character. I'm stunned that any studio actually distributed the movie. The trailer was completely misleading. The only reason the movie got the audience it did was due to the clever wordsmithing and creative depiction on the trailer. That trailer is not representative of the movie you will see.<br /><br />Other than the child... every character in this movie was a sick, murderous, twisted, perverse, violent sex freak and their characters are mirrored the mind of the writer-director who created them. But if you watch it carefully, even the parents of the vacationing family; the sick cops taking pot shots; the serial killers posing in alternate roles; cops in the station; and even the station dispatcher... every single one of these character roles incorporated a sexually, twisted, violent pervert. I'm not too sure about some of the actors after watching them talk about the filming of the movie and the Canadian town in the Special Features section of the DVD.<br /><br />This writer-director has such a personal mental deviation that no matter what she writes, every character role contains those same carbon copy stamps. The only character which did not have these deviant tendencies was the child. Watch closely and you will see this in every character. Then listen to the director-writer talk on the DVD Special Features section and you will understand what I'm telling you about her mental state and psychological issues. She wouldn't be tolerated in too many decent homes if she were not from a Hollywood film making family.<br /><br />Fortunately, Jennifer Chambers Lynch does not have much of a filmography... less than a handful of things. Since she carbon copies those disturbing traits in all of her character roles, I don't think we'll have to see many movies written or directed by her unless her dad, director David Lynch helps her out. I'd recommend staying away from any movie she is involved with... and I'm not too sure her dad's films would be any better.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor. Avoid anything written or directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch."

Ohsumed,2061,test,"A critical appraisal of mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation in depressed patients.  OBJECTIVE: The authors' goal was to evaluate the utility of mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation assays in clinical research in psychoimmunology.  METHOD: They examined 23 depressed patients and 23 matched comparison subjects with this assay.  There were no significant differences between these groups.  They then combined the results of this study with the results of their previous study of 20 depressed patients and 20 comparison subjects to examine possible determinants of lymphocyte proliferation in depression.  RESULTS: Depressed patients with lower proliferative responses than their matched comparison subjects had lower depression subscale, anergia subscale, and total scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale than did patients with higher proliferative responses than their matched comparison subjects.  This finding was unexpected and unexplained.  Depressed patients with lower proliferative responses than their matched comparison subjects also had fewer obsessions and compulsions and less psychomotor agitation according to the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia interview than did patients with higher proliferative responses than their matched comparison subjects.  Stepwise discriminant analysis and cluster analysis contributed little further understanding of the determinants of in vitro lymphocyte proliferation of cells from depressed patients.  CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal studies using multiple serial determinations of mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation are the minimal design needed to make this assay useful in further evaluating any immune system changes in depression."

Recognition that the disease involves a segment of colon rather than only the focal point of perforation is essential to adequate surgical treatment.

Ohsumed,4021,test,"An application of probability theory to a group of breath-alcohol and blood-alcohol data.  Many jurisdictions have ""per se"" driving-while-intoxicated (DWI) status expressed in terms of a blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) standard (in grams per 100 mL or the equivalent).  Since breath-alcohol (BrAC) analysis is typically employed to determine BAC, there is often challenge to the use of an assumed 2100:1 conversion ratio.  This concern may be relevant in light of considerable data that show a low percentage of cases in which BrAC greater than BAC, and this concern increases when the BrAC is used to predict BAC in the context of ""per se"" legislation.  Probability theory provides a basis for estimating the likelihood of an individual having a BrAC greater than or equal to g/210 L with a corresponding BAC less than 0.10 g/100 mL.  Actual field data from the state of Wisconsin (n = 404) were evaluated to determine the probability of this occurrence.  The probability for this occurrence involves the multiplication law for independent events.  The computed probability from the data was 0.018.  The actual number of occurrences where BrAC greater than or equal to 0.10 g/210 L and BAC less than 0.10 g/100 mL was 5, resulting in a probability of 0.012.  The concern of having BrAC greater than BAC at the critical ""per se"" level has a very low probability of occurrence, which thus supports the reasonableness of ""per se"" DWI legislation based upon a blood-alcohol standard determined by breath-alcohol analysis."

IMDb-top_1000,234,test,"First i will say that i am going to be as subjective as I can.<br /><br />There will be some potential spoilers ahead so beware.<br /><br />I hardly ever review movies, but this one in particular i felt i had to review. This movie Final Fantasy 7 Advent Children, based off the ultra popular rpg (Final Fantasy VII) for the ps1 has been in the works for quite some time. After the years of hype and the dozens of trailers (none of which i ever saw, i had only seen stills) this movie got the legions of fans really excited about seeing their favorite characters on the big screen. I myself had played and completed the game a few times like any good fan, and being such a movie freak i was pretty excited myself. So i had thought to myself, ""WHAT COULD GO WRONG?"".<br /><br />Well, the movie started out OK in the first 20 minutes, but then things get out of hand as the movie progressed. Without a doubt, this is the best looking CGI animation around, but that won't help a weak plot, undeveloped characters,and over indulgent action scenes. <br /><br />Here is the story basically. These three silver haired nancy boys in leather who have nothing to do with the game, are supposedly clones of Sephiroth (he's the villain of the game who had supposedly murdered all his supposed clones)are trying to kidnap all the children for some reason that was not really explained all that well, probably to make an army (of kids?) They also center some of the story on some kid named Denzel, i don't know who this kid is, or what his point is, he just seems depressed all the time. So the sephiroth clones also are involved in some kind of scheme involving some disease called geostigma, that only affects the children, this disease seems to cause boredom and small amounts of skin discoloration.<br /><br />So now Cloud must save the day from these guys. Apparently Cloud and his fellow team mates have learned the ability of flight, i felt a little insulted that these characters where flying around a city fighting a dragon and landing on there feet all the time. Maybe if the movie wasn't so over the top, then the view relax into it and then they can be amazed by something incredible. The real problem of this movie is logic. Now i know what you are gonna say, ""But it's called Final FANTASY! it should have those ideas in it!"" well that is a foolish way to think, the game based itself in some kind of reality and the movie should follow through in that CONTEXT. Context and logic in this movie is inconsistent, i could explain it all, but if i did, i would end up writing the screenplay.<br /><br />Also some scenes in this movie were extremely contrived and trite. like when all of the characters from the game show up just in the nick of time for their obligatory screen time so as not to upset the fans. They show up, do there bit and pretty much have no point in the story.<br /><br />If this is too long here is the simpler review-<br /><br />the pros- the first 20 minutes top-notch cgi animation decent action scenes visually stunning<br /><br />the cons- illogical over indulgent action/ unbalanced action (leaves the viewer jaded at the climax) weak plot super human characters=no suspense the j-rock soundtrack/score (what happened to the orchestra?) Horrible ending<br /><br />BIG TIME SPOILER-<br /><br />Now the ending of this movie really disappointed me. they could have had gone the really cool and sweet ending where cloud dies and meets up with aeris in the after life but after the great battle at the end cloud gets shot in the back, the kinda wound where the bullet blast out through the chest. then cloud has his 100th flashback in the movie and then wakes up in a pool of lifestream. (now i remember the lifestream in the game, but it did not have resurrecting properties, if it did, they could have brought aeris back to life, thus making a completely different story) so cloud is brought back to life and everyone has a party and dives into the pool and we have a ultra cheezy hallmark/ lifetime type moment.<br /><br />not that the movie doesn't have it's moments. its is worth seeing for its visuals. but thats all.<br /><br />other than that it's not really a good movie. it is strictly for blinded fans of the game. not for people who care about plot and character and story telling."
Ohsumed,1781,test,"Reducing unnecessary coronary care unit admissions: a comparison of three decision aids   OBJECTIVE: To determine whether published decision rules for ischemic heart disease have practical value in reducing unnecessary admissions to coronary care units.  DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.  SETTING: A community hospital emergency room.  PATIENTS: 235 consecutive patients presenting to an emergency room with a chief complaint of chest pain.  MEASUREMENTS: Clinical information, including observations needed to use previously published decision aids, was collected on special forms at the time of the emergency room visit.  Follow-up information was obtained from the medical records of patients who were admitted and by telephone interviews with patients who were discharged.  The authors compared the residents' actual decisions with the predictions of the decision aids regarding their ability to predict complications (that is, to identify patients who needed admission or intensive care).  MAIN RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: None of the decision aids could reduce unnecessary admissions without seriously increasing the rate of inappropriate discharges.  However, within the clinically relevant subgroup of patients for whom the decision to admit or discharge was not obvious on clinical grounds (those without complications on presentation whom the residents chose not to discharge), the decision aids examined, used in combination to verify the need for admission, might have safely averted some unnecessary admissions."

Ohsumed,375,validation,"Treatment planning for internal radionuclide therapy: three-dimensional dosimetry for nonuniformly distributed radionuclides.  A calculational approach is described that provides the spatially varying radiation absorbed dose, presented as isodose contours superimposed on CT images, from nonuniform and/or irregular cumulated activity distributions.  CT images are read from magnetic tape and are displayed on a high-resolution color graphics display monitor.  Source tissue geometries are defined on a series of contiguous CT images automatically (by an edge detection algorithm) or manually (using a trackball), thereby obtaining a three-dimensional representation of the various source volumes of activity.  Dose calculations are performed using a radionuclide-specific absorbed dose point kernel in the form of a lookup table.  The method described yields the spatially varying dose delivered to tumor and normal tissue volumes from a patient-specific cumulated activity distribution in a clinically implementable manner.  This level of accuracy in determining normal tissue and tumor doses may prove valuable in the evaluation and implementation of radionuclides and radiolabeled compounds for therapeutic purposes."

A retrospective review was done on 13 consecutive patients who underwent PTCA of totally occluded coronary arteries using a recently released thin shaft balloon over-the-wire angioplasty system.  Balloon size was determined by the closest fit to the arterial size and used without predilatation techniques.  This technique was initially successful in 12 patients with only 2 clinically insignificant episodes of distal embolization and one probable early reclosure.

The possibility of detecting myocardial infarction (MI) in the presence of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome by means of body surface QRST isoarea maps was studied in eight dogs.  Eighty-seven body surface ECGs were recorded simultaneously.  Recordings were taken during right atrial (RA) and right atrial and right ventricular (RA + RV) sequential pacing, which simulated WPW syndrome, during control periods and at 1-hour intervals for up to 5 hours after occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery.  In ECGs during the RA drive, diagnostic findings of MI such as abnormal Q waves were observed but became obscure during the RA + RV drive.  On the contrary, the QRST values over the anterior chest during both drives were positive soon after coronary occlusion, decreased gradually as time passed, and became abnormally negative after 5 hours.  The QRST isoarea maps during RA and RA + RV pacing showed quite similar patterns and were highly correlated with each other throughout this study (r greater than 0.95).  These findings demonstrate that localized abnormalities resulting from MI are evident in QRST isoarea maps even in the presence of preexcitation and fusion."

In order to identify the target epitopes recognized by specific CTL in the NEF protein of HIV-1, 33 peptides derived from the HIV-BRU sequence were tested with NEF-specific CTL generated from HIV-seropositive donors.  Six different epitopes were identified and several points were remarkable: 1) They were all located in two regions of the central part of the NEF protein corresponding to residues 73 to 94 and 113 to 147, respectively.  2) The CTL issued from a single donor could recognize several peptides of the NEF protein.  3) Some of these peptides could be recognized in association with at least two or three different HLA class I molecules.  4) Two different overlapping epitopes were present in a relatively short sequence of 15 amino acids.  These results suggest that multiple epitopes corresponding to different HLA restrictions could coexist in a relatively small region of the NEF protein.  The implications of these results in vaccine strategies using synthetic peptides bearing CTL epitopes are discussed."

The frequencies of DR1 and DR4-associated DQw7 alleles, however, were different in these 2 groups of patients.  DR1 was significantly increased only in patients with mild RA, and DR4-associated DQw7 was significantly increased only in patients with severe disease.  The results of the present study, together with previous data from our laboratory and from other investigators on the incidence of HLA-D region antigens in RA, suggest that both DR and DQ (A and B) genes may be important in conferring susceptibility to RA; DR in the mild forms of the disease, and DQ in severe RA."

IMDb-top_1000,90,test,"Oh, where the hell should I begin? Give a brief summary of the story? No. either you've already heard it, or don't want to. Either way, it sucks. Much like the movie. I happen to be a semi-large horror movie aficionado, and I must say this is one of the dumbest and most clumsily-executed movies I've ever had the displeasure of viewing. <br /><br />The script is horrendously stupid. The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest. All of those torture scenes would have been A LOT more effective if we gave even the tiniest bit of crap for the characters. Since the first scene in the film is when the teenage girls meet Capt. Howdy, how the hell are we supposed to sympathize with them? First off, they seem stupid for going to a party with a guy they don't even know, and second, we don't even know their damn names! Why the hell should I care if they live or die? Not to mention the fact that they actually have the guts to try and make us feel sympathetic towards Capt. Howdy after he's been ""reformed""? PLEASE! I was cheering when he got his just deserts! He deserved them! Hell, he deserved worse! Also, we're forced to sit through a pointless misdirect sequence lifted directly from ""The Silence of the Lambs"" (and here it's done HORRIBLY! Of course he's gonna give them a false address! And even if he had given them the real one, don't you think he'd be waiting and not piercing some guy's Johnson upstairs? RETARDED!)<br /><br />Then there's the dialogue. Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid. ""The dead are so dreadfully dead, when they're dead""?? What the hell kind of crap is that?! Dee Snider at one point says ""knowledge is power"". Well, if that's true, this film has absolutely no power whatsoever. <br /><br />Then, there's the plot holes. Yes, I know this is a horror film (well, wannabe horror film), but damn! You could drive a semi truck into these holes! First off, these have got to be the DUMBEST cops I have EVER SEEN! EVER!! I mean, DEAR GOD, these guys are morons! Call for backup, idiots! Second, how the hell did that humungous septum ring fall out of Captain Howdy's nose?! Evidentially this piercing expert guy says ""that's the biggest one I've ever seen"", but if it's so damn big, how the hell could it have fallen out so easily? Did Capt. Howdy just LEAVE it at the crime scene because he WANTED to get caught? They sure didn't make it seem like he did. Also, they would NEVER release Capt. Howdy, and I know that for a damn fact. He would be in jail for the rest of his life, and there's no getting around this. Much less let him return to his old house where he killed/tortured everybody. IMPOSSIBLE AND IMPLAUSIBLE. <br /><br />And now the acting. Dear God did these people suck. Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film. She's poised and amazing. Too bad she hardly gets a good chance to act in this piece of crap. Amy Smart shows up for about 10 minutes and then drops out of existence. Even the usually entertaining Robert Englund is underused and ineffective here. Dee Snider plays the crazy guy with no talent whatsoever. I never felt threatened, scared or intimidated. I'd rather have seen Dee Snider in Alexis Arquette's role in ""Bride of Chucky"". It would have been so much more fun to see this talent-less hack get it by that lovable psycho doll. <br /><br />Dee Snider just plain sucks. He can't act (one of the least scary villains I have ever seen), he can't write (did he write this damn movie in his sleep?), and he's obviously dumber than freaking Jessica Simpson! This film is just a way for Dee Snider to show off all the weird crap he knows about self-mutilation and modern primitives and blah-blah-blah. Either it's been done before or it just didn't need to be done. I was bored throughout the whole damn thing. <br /><br />The acting sucks, the music sucks, the script sucks, the pacing sucks, the special FX suck, the directing sucks... basically, this movie sucks. This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably. It doesn't manage to scare, shock, or disturb in any shape, way or form. This is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films I have ever seen in my entire life. A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid. <br /><br />""Strangeland"" gets a 0 out of 10. Avoid at any and all costs. Not enjoyable in the slightest."

Ohsumed,2315,test,"Molecular characterization of a major nephritogenic domain in the autoantigen of anti-tubular basement membrane disease.  Anti-tubular basement membrane (alpha TBM) disease is a form of primary interstitial nephritis mediated by autoimmune T cells and alpha TBM antibodies.  In mice and humans the nephritogenic immune response is directed to a glycoprotein (3M-1) found along the proximal tubule of the kidney.  We have isolated cDNAs from an expression library that encodes for the common framework domain of the 3M-1 antigen.  This common domain was once related evolutionarily to a family of intermediate filament-associated proteins.  Northern hybridization revealed that all isoforms of 3M-1 range between 1700 and 1900 base pairs and in situ hybridization studies indicate that transcripts are found in tubular epithelium.  Candidate peptide fragments were deduced and synthesized from the sequence encoding this common framework domain, and one of the peptide residues was able to bind a monoclonal 3M-1-reactive alpha TBM antibody, stimulate the growth of 3M-1-reactive helper T cells, and induce nephritogenic effector T cells capable of producing interstitial nephritis.  Our results indicate that a unique, immunodominant region of the 3M-1 antigen is an informative participant in the emergence of autoimmune injury to certain basement membranes."
IMDb-top_1000,191,test,"I'm surprised with the questions and issues this documentary has brought up in the reviews here, specially because they're indeed interesting questions. Surely, the ones who could best address it would be the makers of the film themselves. Nevertheless, I think I can shed some light upon something that I think has been overlooked, which is, in my opinion, the purpose of the film, what it is about and what it's trying to convey. What's its message after all? At the risk of pointing out the very obvious, I'll start saying the filmmakers have an intention. They're trying to tell a story, extract meaning out of it and get a point across. With this in mind, we can shoot down many of the criticized points, particularly the ones involving what people expected in contrast with what the filmmakers were really trying to show. Causes and consequences of violence? The film is not about that. It's not ""enlightening Non-Brazilian audiences"" about the Brazilian favelas' issue? Well, who wanted to do that? Is AfroReggae this or that and supported by whom? It doesn't matter in this context. Not enough women in the film for your tastes? It's not about equality or the feminist cause. Every little detail about Anderson's life, mother, son, family and all the aspects and the workings of the AfroReggae movement? Well, don't be so picky because it doesn't matter. There's just so much length a story can have before it can't become a film anymore. If the authors were to show everything everyone is expecting, they'd have to make a 6 months TV series instead. If you are expecting all that, you approach the film the wrong way.<br /><br />The film is actually about two individuals who started a movement. Two individuals full of ideals. Two individuals who thirst for change. Two individuals trying to do something about all the wrongdoing going around them. Individuals who went rock bottom and wanted to get up again. It's all about finding purpose in life, drawing inspiration from misery, changing the destiny and becoming something else than what they were destined to be -- criminals and drug dealers for that matter. It's about achievement and hope and not about the cruel reality of violence in Rio de Janeiro, though it's an integral part of the film given that's what the characters are constantly surrounded by. Unexpectedly and not without a reason, the film ends up centered much more on Anderson's course through difficulties in life. This is because they were faced with Anderson's accident while they were shooting the film. I'm not sure about this, but they may have even seriously considered ending the filming right there, leaving behind all effort spent. But Anderson wanted to keep going. And so they did, risking to lose in having a film with a bit of an identity crisis, considering the sudden change of course, but gaining in showing someone overcoming such a devastating happening. It's very evident for who watches it that the film begins about AfroReggae and winds up about Anderson. It's very unique in this sense (the shift of the story line). Maybe their only sin is not making it evident upfront, which may initially rise expectations that will go unfulfilled.<br /><br />As for the importance or ordinariness of Anderson, I'd say not everybody wants to change the whole world, end all violence, feed all the hungry, be like Mahatma Ghandi, be as known as Mother Teresa or whoever other known personalities there are. It's much easier to relate to and draw inspiration from someone who is, such as everybody else in fact, trying to transform his or her own harsh life, raising problematic kids, coping with permanent injuries or diseases and even managing to pay the bills by the end of the month. To understand the movie you have to see that's about leaving behind a past of involvement with drugs and crime, making up for it, and trying to persuade others not to go down the same troublesome path. Though you can criticize if the way they chose to do it is effective and doubt the ideology of the method, you cannot deny their intentions.<br /><br />Also, the perception that Anderson is special or a chosen one may have partially something to do with the fact that the filmmakers became very involved in the lives of the characters they were depicting. As much as becoming friends with them. There's no way it wouldn't tint the whole movie with a more favorable light over Anderson. If a dear friend becomes paralyzed in an accident, it's not just a fact, you make a big deal out of it. And this is not necessarily bad. It's not much that they treat him like ""a chosen one"" as much as they go to great lengths trying to show him as a seed for transformation and source of inspiration.<br /><br />In conclusion, don't watch this documentary for the scenes of the reality of poverty and crime it contains, watch it for what it is much more, an inspirational story.<br /><br />Nike-Ad-like? Seems just damn good and professionally made to me and doesn't affect or detract from the intentions of the film. Romanticized? Speculate on its credential as a documentary if you will, but why not when it's supposed to cause reaction and inspire? Isn't trying to better people's lives through music and dance -- the essence of what the subjects are trying to do -- romanticizing the very own reality? Pardon me, but showing just the plain facts is what reporters do and you can watch it on TV every night.<br /><br />If I wanted to become a filmmaker, I wish my first film would also be this great."

Ohsumed,1729,test,"Carbon tetrachloride-induced alterations of hepatic calmodulin and free calcium levels in rats pretreated with chlordecone.  Calmodulin, a low molecular weight Ca2+ binding protein, regulates a large number of cell activities including cell division.  Previous studies from our laboratory indicated excessive accumulation of Ca2+ in hepatocytes succeeded by rapid glycogen breakdown and suppressed cell division in rats receiving CCl4 after previous dietary exposure to 10 ppm chlordecone.  Since calmodulin plays a major role in Ca2(+)-regulated events and has been reported to be localized in mitotic apparatus during cell division, we have assessed subcellular distribution of calmodulin and estimated cytosolic phosphorylase a to indicate cytosolic free Ca2+ levels in livers of rats fed 0 ppm or 10 ppm (chlordecone) in the diet for 15 days before CCl4 (100 microliters/kg) administration to understand the role of Ca2(+)-calmodulin in chlordecone + CCl4 toxicity.  Hepatotoxicity was assessed by determining serum AST and ALT succeeded by histopathological observations of liver sections.  Serum aminotransferases were significantly elevated 6 hr after CCl4 administration to normal rats and returned to control level by 24 hr.  However, serum AST and ALT elevations were severalfold higher, and progressive increase was observed starting 4 hr after CCl4 administration to chlordecone rats.  Histopathological observations of liver sections for necrotic, swollen and lipid-laden cells provided findings commensurate with the serum enzyme data.  These data indicate that normal rats do recover from CCl4 hepatotoxicity.  However, the CCl4 hepatotoxicity is progressive in chlordecone rats without recovery.

Ohsumed,2660,test,"The epidemiology and clinical aspects of the hemolytic uremic syndrome in Minnesota   BACKGROUND.  The frequency of the hemolytic uremic syndrome, characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure, is increasing.  Although Escherichia coli serotype 0157:H7 has been implicated as a causative agent, more information is needed about the basic epidemiology and clinical aspects of this syndrome.  METHODS.  We conducted a retrospective population-based study of hemolytic uremic syndrome in Minnesota residents less than 18 years of age from 1979 through 1988 to assess trends in disease occurrence, describe the clinical illness, and identify predictors of disease severity and outcome.  We also conducted a case-control study of patients with onsets of illness from 1986 through 1988 to examine risk factors.  RESULTS.  One hundred seventeen patients were identified.  The mean annual incidence increased from 0.5 case per 100,000 child-years among children less than 18 in 1979 (6 cases) to 2.0 cases per 100,000 in 1988 (26 cases) (P = 0.000004).  E.  coli 0157:H7 was isolated from 13 of 28 patients (46 percent) who had stool specimens submitted for testing.  For those who presented with typical hemolytic uremic syndrome, an elevated polymorphonuclear-leukocyte count on hospital admission, a shorter duration of prodrome, and the presence of bloody diarrhea were predictive of severe disease.  In the case-control study, the patients were more likely to attend large daycare centers (more than 50 children) than were the controls (odds ratio, 10.2; P = 0.03), suggesting that day-care attendance may be a risk factor.  On the basis of the population-attributable risk, however, this factor could account for no more than 16 percent of the cases.  CONCLUSIONS.  This study provides evidence for an increase in the incidence of hemolytic uremic syndrome, which is probably related to an increased incidence of E.  coli 0157:H7 infections.  Hemolytic uremic syndrome has become an important pediatric and public health problem."

Ohsumed,3835,test,"Precapsular film on the aging human lens: precursor of pseudoexfoliation?  In many older patients we observed a layer of subtle opacification on the anterior lens capsule, appearing as a ground glass film biomicroscopically.  This precapsular film (PCF) could be uniform but often had radial grey lines in the mid zone, holes in the paracentral region, and was occasionally rolled up in strings.  Lens capsular material obtained at cataract extraction was studied in patients with and without the film.  By scanning electron microscopy the PCF appeared as a friable, incomplete fibrillar layer, with rolling of the edges suggesting loose attachment.  Ultrastructurally its component fibrils were from 3-6 nm in diameter, similar to the finer fibrils in pseudoexfoliation (PSX) material.  Life PSX material the layer stained positively for the elastic microfibril-associated protein, fibrillin, in a lens with radial striations.  These similarities suggested that the two conditions have some relationship and that the PCF may be a precursor of PSX.  Finding patches of the fibrillar network in some control patients implies that the PCF is common in patients of cataract age, though seldom detected clinically."

We measured the effects of cimetidine on antibiotic concentrations in the luminal portion of gastric mucosa.  Guinea pigs were premedicated with cimetidine 4 mg/kg intramuscularly.  Clindamycin, an antibiotic previously characterized under physiologic pH conditions, was administered intramuscularly and levels measured in serum and tissue using a high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique.  The luminal mucosa concentration of clindamycin at 1 hr (pH 5.9) was fivefold greater compared to the concentrations seen under physiologic (pH 2.0) conditions (81.5 micrograms/g vs 15.9 micrograms/g; P less than 0.05) and 10-fold greater at 2 hr (82.7 micrograms/g vs 8.09 micrograms/g; P less than 0.05).  There was no difference in peak serum levels between the groups.  The finding that an antibiotic with characteristics of a base is thus affected by a nonconservative acid inhibitor such as cimetidine supports the presence of an acidic storage pool as proposed by other investigators.

SPA in WB was inhibited by in vitro addition of aspirin and apyrase, and SPA was only partially dependent on high platelet count because it also occurred in samples with normal platelet content (at variance with 13 subjects with reactive thrombocytosis, in which SPA was observed only in samples with high platelet concentration).  Platelets from patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis had the highest tendency to undergo SPA."
Ohsumed,490,test,"Risk factors for gestational diabetes in black population.  In a long-term longitudinal study of gestational diabetes mellitus in Black women, risk factors that were identified were age, obesity, a family history of diabetes, and the presence of hypertension.  Poor predictors were a history of a previous large-for-date infant, parity, and age at first pregnancy.  The prevalence of smooth muscle and nuclear autoantibodies was higher in gestational diabetic subjects.  Gestational diabetic subjects who required insulin for glycemic control were more obese, had a lower frequency of the Bf-F phenotype and a higher frequency of the Bf-F1 phenotype, and had a lower frequency of the type 2 allele at the polymorphic locus adjacent to the insulin gene.  Restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms flanking the insulin and apolipoprotein A-I and C-III genes, although not associated with gestational diabetes mellitus, may be associated with hyperlipidemia and subsequent atherosclerosis."

Ohsumed,3193,test,"Surgical treatment for limited small-cell lung cancer. The University of Toronto Lung Oncology Group experience.  Since 1977, 119 patients with limited small-cell lung cancer have undergone combined modality therapy including surgery at our institution.  Seventy-nine patients (58 male, 21 female; median age 63 years) had surgery first, and 67 of these had adjuvant chemotherapy.  Forty (27 male, 13 female; median age 59 years) had chemotherapy first, and 94% had a complete or partial response before the operation.  Pretreatment staging revealed 69 stage I, 27 stage II, and 23 stage III tumors.  Twenty-six patients required pneumonectomy, 88 lobectomy, and five had no resection.  Four patients had gross and six had microscopic residual disease.  Postoperative pathologic examination showed small-cell lung cancer only (n = 95), non-small-cell lung cancer (n = 3), mixed (n = 17), and no residual tumor (n = 4).  Postoperative staging revealed 35 stage I, 36 stage II, and 48 stage IIIa tumors.  The median survival of the entire group is 111 weeks and the projected 5-year survival rate is 39%.  No survival difference was seen between patients treated with chemotherapy before the operation and those undergoing an initial operation followed by chemotherapy (p = 0.756).  The median survival for patients with pathologic stage I disease has not been reached, and the projected 5-year survival rate is 51%.  This is significantly better than for the patients with stage II (median 82 weeks, p = 0.001) or stage III (median 83 weeks, p = 0.001) disease, who have projected 5-year survival rates of 28% and 19%, respectively.  Seven of the 12 patients who had no adjuvant chemotherapy remain alive at 6 to 48+ months.  Sixty-seven patients have died (11 had no evidence of disease).  Only 10 patients had a relapse in the primary site alone, seven at the primary and distant sites, and 39 only in distant sites.  In summary, resection improves control at the primary site, and a significant proportion of patients with stage I (N0) disease achieve long-term survival and cure with combined modality therapy including surgery.  Stage II and IIIa patients have survival predictions similar to stage IIIa non-small-cell lung carcinoma treated surgically."

Mean heart rates in the management and technical team were higher than those of the players.  The recognised circadian pattern of heart rate, with a peak in the morning waking hours, was altered similarly during both concert days, with a primary peak occurring in the evening hours and a lesser peak in the morning for both musicians and management/technical staff.  This study showed that environmental factors are of primary importance in defining the circadian pattern of heart rate.

IMDb-top_1000,73,validation,"I saw this movie at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival.<br /><br />Based on the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer, Everything Is Illuminated is the directorial debut of actor Liev Schreiber. Schreiber also wrote the screenplay. In the movie, Jonathan (Elijah Wood) obsessively collects items from his family, from toothbrushes to retainers to scraps of paper which he then seals in ziploc bags and pins to a wall in his house to record his family history. But the space for his grandfather is conspicuously bare. All Jonathan really has of him is a piece of jewelry and an old photo of him with a woman who hid him from the Nazis during the Second World War. Jonathan decides to undertake a quest to Ukraine to find the woman, thank her, and learn more about his grandfather.<br /><br />His quest is aided there by a couple of characters who run a tourist company for Jewish people, including a young man obsessed with western culture (Eugene Hutz), his grandfather (Boris Leskin), who thinks he is blind and who may have memories and demons of his own from the war, and his grandfather's temperamental seeing eye dog.<br /><br />The screenplay effectively combines both humour and drama as the three characters travel through the countryside looking for Jonathan's grandfather's town, driving deeper and deeper into the memories of the past. The best performance probably comes from Eugene Hutz, playing Alex Jr., who starts the movie as a tracksuit-wearing, break dancing slacker just out to have fun but evolves into something more as not only Jonathan, but all the characters gain their own illumination.<br /><br />Liev Schreiber, Elijah Wood, and Eugene Hutz attended the screening and did a very humorous Q&A after the film: <br /><br />- Schreiber was very close to his grandfather, who was a Ukranian immigrant, and who died in 1993. This caused him to start to write to get his memories down on paper. Meanwhile, he was asked to do a reading of Foer's short story, The Very Rigid Search, which was an excerpt from the still unpublished novel. Schreiber was blown away by the quality of the writing, saying that Foer had done in 15 pages what Schreiber tried to do in 107. Schreiber approached Foer and they talked about their grandfathers, culture, movies, and the nature of short-term memory in America; in the end, Foer agreed to let Schreiber adapt the book.<br /><br />- Schreiber's own project was intended to be a road movie, but the book has parallel narrative that is an imagined chronological history of the town of Trochenbrod that spans 500 years; given his budget and limitations as a filmmaker, he said he'd leave that to Milos Forman and take the road trip instead. This imagined chronology was what moved him to make the movie in the first place, the idea that ""a past lovingly imagined was as valuable as a past accurately recalled"".<br /><br />- Schreiber said the movie was a series of happy accidents. After searching unsuccessfully in Ukraine for an actor, he was walking through the Lower East Side in New York, when he saw a poster of a woman centaur, topless from the waist up, with an insane cossack sitting astride her. Under the poster said the name Gogol Bordello Ukranian Punk Gypsy Band.<br /><br />Eugene Hutz then took over the story. He had never pursued acting as music was his first passion. One day, a friend gave him the book, and he thought it was written in a manner similar to how he writes music; screw sentences/syntax, language is my own.<br /><br />Later, they got a call from a production company, looking for eastern European music that was medieval but modern. Hutz met with Schreiber, and he soon found the movie was based on the book he just happened to be reading. Not long after that came up, Schreiber asked Hutz what he thought about Alex and whether he could do the character by any chance.<br /><br />- Foer and Schreiber talked about the film in the fall of 2001, shortly after the events of September 11. Both were in Europe at the time and they talked about the derogatory comments they were hearing about Americans, which led Schreiber to want to try to find an articulate American who would defy the stereotype that Europeans have of Americans. Someone who was awkward, vulnerable, flawed, innocent, and looking for history beyond the borders of his own country. Schreiber started thinking about who that was, and Elijah came up.<br /><br />One of Schreiber's inspirations as a filmmaker is Emir Kusturica (I think that's who he said, who also directed a segment in another festival movie, All the Invisible Children) who said ""you don't look for the actors, you look for the people."" Schreiber said there is something about who Elijah is that he has a generosity of spirit and a sincere goodness as a human being, that came across on film. Schreiber said that the eyes are important when trying to articulate a character who is an observer, and that if ""eyes are the doors to the soul, Elijah's are garage doors."" <br /><br />- Elijah Wood had fun with a question about the similarities between his character Kevin in Sin City and Jonathan in this movie as both are sort of a blank slate on which emotions are projected. Wood replied that Jonathan may seem still and seemingly emotionless, but it is all about his observations, about his experiences with other characters and the environment he was in.<br /><br />- On the differences between directing and writing: Schreiber said he likes writing a lot more and jokingly described directing as ""hell"". After his grandfather died, Schreiber started to think about how to preserve some sense of history and himself; is he content driven or not, or just good at interpreting other people's work? He said he loved the exercise of figuring out what is emotional to you, important to you."
Ohsumed,2742,test,"Theophylline minimally alters contractile properties of canine diaphragm in vitro.  We examined the effects of theophylline on contractile properties and high-frequency fatigue of canine diaphragm in vitro.  Eighteen diaphragm muscle bundles were obtained from 10 anesthetized dogs and equilibrated in oxygenated Krebs solution to 100, 200, or 300 mg/l theophylline.  These bundles were compared with 18 matched control bundles from the contralateral hemidiaphragm.  No statistically significant differences in twitch tension, tetanic tension, twitch-to-tetanus ratio, time to peak tension, or half-relaxation time were observed.  Concentrations of 300 mg/l theophylline, however, significantly (P less than 0.05) increased force production at 10 Hz by 32%.  A similar tendency was present at lower concentrations and exhibited a clear dose-response behavior.  High-frequency fatigue was similar in control and theophylline-treated bundles.  We conclude that supratherapeutic in vitro concentrations of theophylline do not increase maximal tetanic tension and do not protect against muscle fatigue but potentiate relative force production at low stimulation frequencies.  This relatively small effect cannot be explained by poor diffusion of the drug in the muscle bundle, because theophylline concentrations in the muscle bath and in the muscle bundle were virtually identical.  Moreover, it remains unclear whether this potentially beneficial effect can be achieved at in vivo attainable serum concentrations."

IMDb-top_1000,230,test,"After some internet surfing, I found the ""Homefront"" series on DVD at ioffer.com. Before anyone gets excited, the DVD set I received was burned by an amateur from home video tapes recorded off of their TV 15 years ago. The resolution and quality are poor. The images look like you would expect old re-recorded video to look. Although the commercials were edited out, the ending credits of each episode still have voice-over announcements for the segway into the ABC news program ""Nightline"", complete with the top news headlines from the early 1990's. Even with the poor image quality, the shows were watch-able and the sound quality was fine.<br /><br />To this show's credit, the casting was nearly perfect. Everyone was believable and really looked the part. Their acting was also above average. The role of Jeff Metcalf is played particularly well by Kyle Chandler (most recently seen in the 2005 remake of King Kong). The period costumes were very authentic as were the sets, especially the 1940s kitchens with vintage appliances and décor. The direction was also creative and different for a TV show at that time. For example, conversations between characters were sometimes inter-cut with conversations about the same subject between other characters in different scenes. The dialog of the different conversations was kept fluid despite cutting back and fourth between the different characters and locations. That takes good direction and editing and they made it work in this case.<br /><br />As I started watching this series again I suddenly remembered why I lost interest in it 15 years ago. Despite all the ingredients for a fine show, the plots and story lines are disappointing and confusing right from the start. For one thing, the name of the show itself is totally misleading. When WWII ended in 1945, there was no more fighting so obviously there was no longer a ""homefront"" either. Curiously, the first episode of the show ""Homefront"" begins in 1945 after the war had ended. That's like shooting the first episode of ""Gilligan's Island"" showing the castaways being rescued. The whole premise of the show's namesake is completely lost. I still held on to hope with the possibility of the rest of the series being a flashback but no, the entire show takes place from 1946 through 1948. Additionally, this series fails miserably in any attempt to accurately portray any historical events of the late 1940's. By the third episode, it becomes obvious that this series was nothing more than a thinly veiled vehicle for an ultra left-wing political agenda. The show is set in River Run Ohio, near Toledo. However, the show's ongoing racism theme makes it look more like Jackson Mississippi than Ohio. Part of the ensemble cast are Dick Williams, Hattie Winston and Sterling Macer Jr. who portray the Davis family. Much of the series shows the Davis family being discriminated against by the evil ""whites"" to the point of being ridiculous and totally absurd if not laughable. The racism card has been played and over played by Hollywood now for over 40 years. We get it. We're also tired of having our noses rubbed in it on a daily basis. The subject of racism is also unpopular with viewers and it is the kiss of death for any show, as it was for ""Homefront"". The acting talents of Williams, Winston and Macer were wasted in their roles as the stereotypical ""frightened / angry black family"". The wildly exaggerated racism in this series makes it look like everyone in Ohio was a KKK member or something. The racism issue could have been addressed in this show in a single episode with a simple punch in the nose or fist-fight in which a bigot gets a well deserved thrashing, and leave it at that. Devoting a major portion of the series to the racism thing gets really old really quick and its just plain stupid.<br /><br />In yet another ridiculous plot line, the big boss of a local factory (Ken Jenkins) is portrayed as an Ebenezer Scrooge like character who is against pensions and raises and is unconcerned about acid dripping on his employees. The workers revolt and take over the factory in a blatant pro-communist propaganda message to the viewer.<br /><br />Personally, I think this series had great potential. The writers could have easily placed the timeline in 1941  1945 as the title suggests and shown the hardships of food and gas rationing and working 14 hour days at war factories. Of course the loss of brothers, sons and husbands fighting overseas would have also added drama. The situation was also perfect for writing in special guest stars as military or USO personnel passing through their town during training or en-route to Europe or the Pacific. The possibilities for good story lines and plots are endless. But no, the writers of Homefront (David Assael and James Grissom) completely ignored any relevant or interesting plots. Instead, they totally missed the point and strayed into a bizarre and irrelevant obsession with racism and left-wing politics. It would be unfair to the actors to condemn the entire series but the plots and situations in which they were placed are total garbage."

Equation 1 includes the residual lung volume (RV) as a factor and had a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.85 and a standard error of the estimate (SEE) of 3.9%.  Equation 2 does not include the RV and has an r of 0.82 and an SEE of 4.3%.  Both equations were more precise than two previous widely used equations.  In a subgroup of 37 subjects who underwent weight loss, equation 1 gave a more precise estimate of the change in PBF.

Ohsumed,1650,test,"Dystrophin is required for normal thin filament-membrane associations at myotendinous junctions.  Dystrophin, the deficient gene product in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, is located subjacent to the muscle cell membrane at myotendinous junctions, as well as along the entire muscle cell.  Myotendinous junctions are sites at which thin filaments normally are linked to one another and to the cell membrane, by both lateral and end-on associations between the thin filaments and membrane.  The cell membrane at these sites in normal muscle is folded extensively.  Dystrophic junctions display normal contacts between the ends of thin filaments and subsarcolemmal densities.  However dystrophic junctions are deficient in lateral associations between thin filaments and the membrane and display less membrane folding than controls.  These structural defects would result in stress concentrations at sites of thin filament attachment to the membrane, which can cause membrane tearing during muscle activation, especially in large-diameter and mature muscle cells.  This deficiency in dystrophic myotendinous junction structure may contribute to our understanding of previously unaccountable aspects of the etiology of Duchenne muscular dystrophy."

Ohsumed,1240,test,"Transmural myocardial deformation in the ischemic canine left ventricle.  The myocardium is a complex three-dimensional structure consisting of myocytes interconnected by a dense collagen weave that courses in different directions.  Regional ischemia can be expected to produce complex changes in ventricular deformation.  In the present study, we examined the effects of ischemia on two- and three-dimensional finite strains during acute transmural myocardial ischemia in 13 open-chest anesthetized dogs.  In contrast to systolic deformation observed during the control period in which circumferential shortening exceeded longitudinal shortening, our results indicate that after 5 minutes of acute ischemia, end-systolic in-plane lengthening across the left ventricular wall occurs in approximately equal amounts in the circumferential and longitudinal directions.  Along with these changes in extensional strains, there were significant negative transverse shearing deformations during ischemia.  Myocardial ischemia also resulted in a loss of the normal end-systolic transmural gradients of shortening and thickening.  Three-dimensional end-diastolic strains indicate that the left ventricular wall undergoes a significant passive reconfiguration that varies transmurally with lengthening in the epicardial tangent plane and wall thinning increasing from the epicardium toward the endocardium.  The large systolic changes in shearing deformations with ischemia could potentially influence collateral blood flow and certainly indicate that uniaxial measurements of deformation in the ischemic myocardium, which do not account for shearing deformation, are incomplete and must be interpreted with caution.  Moreover, normal transmural systolic gradients in deformation, which would be anticipated on geometric grounds, are lost during ischemia, implying that the material properties of ischemic tissue or the loading conditions imposed on the ischemic region by partially impaired adjacent myocardium vary transmurally."

IMDb-top_1000,120,validation,"It just goes to show how wrong you can be. I had not expected to like this film. I was disappointed by both the Kill Bill films (although i preferred the second) and Death Proof (although it was better in the shorter cut of the double-bill release). I love Reservoir Dogs, admire Pulp Fiction and think that Jackie Brown is Tarantino's most mature piece of film-making - technically his most superior - including the last great performance elicited from Robert De Niro. Since then it seems to me while his films have been okay (i haven't hated them) he has been treading water in referential, reverential, self-indulgent juvenilia.<br /><br />Then i read the script last year for Inglourious Basterds - and i hated it! Sure it had some typical QT flourishes and the opening scene was undeniably powerful. There were a couple of great characters. But on page it was more juvenile rubbish, largely ruined by the largess of the uninteresting Basterds of the title. It made me seriously contemplate not seeing the film. The trailers did nothing to convince me. I only changed by mind when i had the opportunity to see the film with a Tarantino Q&A following in London. I figured it would be worth enduring to hear him in Q&A as i know from interviews how entertaining he can be in person.<br /><br />So little was i prepared for the sheer exuberant fun and brilliance of Inglourious Basterds.<br /><br />Easily Mr Tarantino's best work since Jackie Brown it is a triumph.<br /><br />Yes the references are there but they do not interfere with the story, they are not the driving force. Yes Eli Roth is stunt casting but he works fine, with little to do but look aggressive, and does nothing to hurt the film as i had feared. While i admired Mr Tarantino for using stuntwoman Zoe Bell as herself in Death Proof in order to amp-up the exhilaration of the major stunt scene her lack of any acting ability in a key role was a problem for the film. The same could be said of Tarantino's own appearances in several films, especially Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk Till Dawn, which Tarantino wrote.<br /><br />What really makes this work is how BIG it is. The spaghetti western vibe to much of the style, dialogue and performances is wonderfully over the top without descending too far into the cartoon quality of Kill Bill. The violence is so big. The audacity so big. Brad Pitt is so big! In the trailers the Hitler moment and Pitt's performance bothered me but in the context of the film they are hilarious. Pitt is actually brilliant here, exactly what he needs to be. He is Mifune's blustering samurai in Yojimbo, he is Robards Cheyenne from Once Upon a Time in the West, there is a very James Coburn vibe to him, and of course a suitably Lee Marvin edge.<br /><br />Christoph Waltz (who i did not previously known) and Melanie Laurent (who i first noticed in a brilliant French-language British short film by Sean Ellis) are sensational and i expect to see both used a lot more in the future. Tarantino has clearly not lost his eye for casting, which seemed to desert him in Death Proof. Waltz is equally large in his performance. Chilling, yet theatrical. He is Fonda from OUATITW, Van Cleef from Good, The Bad & the Ugly. And Laurent is suitably Cardinale innocence but tough, a fighter. They both dazzle here.<br /><br />That every member of the cast gets the fun to be had from what they are doing while not indulging themselves in just having fun and trying to get laughs helps tremendously. The laughs - and there are loads - come organically. Only Mike Myers comes close to tipping the wink and pushing it too far but his scene is reigned in just enough - with the help of a fantastic Michael Fassbender who seems pulled directly from the mold of Attenborough's Great Escape leader.<br /><br />All the actors shine and Tarantino throws in wonderful flourishes, but ones that work with the story. The introduction of Schweiger's Hugo Stiglitz is a riot. After a sensational slow-burn opening and a glorious intro to those inglourious Basterds the pace never lets up and over two and half hours flies by.<br /><br />It also looks beautiful, marking this as a return to real film-making rather than just self-indulgent silliness. The musical choices, as always, are inspired from Morricone on.<br /><br />The film is audacious and hilarious. After a summer when nearly every film has disappointed me it came as a huge surprise that the real fun and entertaining, but also involving and impressive film should be this one, when i would never have believed it from script form. Welcome back QT."

Even when 2-week-old donor rats were exposed to complete ischemia for 90 minutes, functions of the spinal cord were comparatively preserved.  In histopathologic observations, degeneration proportional to complete ischemia duration was noted.

Ohsumed,745,test,"Molecular genetic basis of maple syrup urine disease in a family with two defective alleles for branched chain acyltransferase and localization of the gene to human chromosome 1.  Maple syrup urine disease in humans results from inherited defects in branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase, a mitochondrial multienzyme complex.  A variety of genetic changes may produce this phenotype by affecting the function of any of the three complex-specific subunits.  The varied clinical expression observed in patients may be partially explained by the defects in the involved subunit.  Here we report localization of the gene for the branched chain acyltransferase component of the complex to human chromosome 1 and describe a proband who is a compound heterozygote at this locus.  One allele, inherited from the father, produces transcripts with 124 nucleotides deleted from the coding region.  The deletion is not found in the branched chain acyltransferase gene, implying that the deleted transcripts arise by an error in transcript processing.  Cells from the patient's mother contain 50% of the normal amount of mRNA for the subunit, and the proband has inherited this nonexpressing allele from her.  As a result, the proband produces no acyltransferase protein and therefore has greatly impaired complex activity.  A phenotypically normal sibling is shown to be genetically similar to the mother having inherited the mother's nonexpressing allele and the father's normal allele."

There is also strong evidence for a network of interacting cytokines, which has been only partially characterized so far, maintaining a proper balance.  However, excessive or insufficient production of these mediators may contribute to certain disease states, particularly those with infectious and autoimmune genesis.

Ohsumed,1417,test,"Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid mediator levels 5 minutes after allergen challenge in atopic subjects with asthma: relationship to the development of late asthmatic responses.  Inflammatory mediators have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human asthma and have been demonstrated to increase in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid during the time of the immediate asthmatic response (IAR) after allergen instillation in the lungs.  However, the relationship of these mediators, measured early to the late asthmatic response (LAR), airway reactivity, and clinical asthma, is unknown.  In the present study, we evaluated mediator levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid before and 5 minutes after allergen challenge from three subject groups: atopic subjects without asthma (N = 7), atopic subjects with asthma and without LAR [-) LAR) (N = 6), and atopic subjects with asthma and with LAR [+) LAR) (N = 6).  Subjects with asthma were differentiated into subjects with and without LARs based on at least a 15% decrease in FEV1 between 3 to 8 hours postallergen inhalation.  The mediators, prostaglandin D2 thromboxane B2 leukotriene C4 (LTC4), and histamine, were measured both before and after allergen instillation.  Baseline prechallenge levels were similar, except in the case of LTC4.  LTC4 was detectable at baseline significantly more frequently in the atopic subjects with asthma with and without LAR when these subjects were compared to the atopic subjects without asthma (nine of 12 detectable versus one of seven detectable).  In all groups, significant increases in mediator levels were observed in the groups with asthma postallergen challenge, compared to the atopic subjects without asthma.  Atopic subjects with asthma and without LAR had significantly higher levels of all four mediators after challenge than atopic subjects with asthma and with LAR and atopic subjects without asthma."

Ohsumed,55,validation,"An analysis of randomized trials evaluating the effect of cholesterol reduction on total mortality and coronary heart disease incidence.  The primary aim of this study was to estimate the relation between cholesterol reduction and total mortality and coronary heart disease (CHD) incidence.  Secondarily, the clinical issues of whether the efficacy of cholesterol lowering is dependent on the treatment modality, presence of CHD at baseline, or the simultaneous introduction of other interventions was explored.  All randomized clinical intervention trials of cholesterol reduction were used in an overview analysis of total mortality rate and CHD incidence; analysis was performed with weighted linear regression.  The trials include those that used primary and secondary intervention, diet and drugs, and single or multifactor design.  Nineteen trials were analyzed for total mortality, and of the 19, 16 were analyzed for CHD incidence rate.  Net difference in cholesterol change between study groups was used as the independent variable, and the three previously mentioned dichotomous design characteristics were used as additional independent variables.  For every 1% reduction in cholesterol, an estimated 2.5% reduction in CHD incidence is indicated (95% CL: 1.1, 3.9).  With regard to CHD drug trials tended toward better efficiency in cholesterol lowering than did dietary trials.  With regard to total mortality, this efficiency was higher in secondary than in primary preventive trials.  The efficiency was also somewhat dependent on the baseline cholesterol level.  This study shows that cholesterol reduction is effective in lowering CHD incidence, but cholesterol reduction must be at least 8-9% to be effective in lowering total mortality."

Ohsumed,1507,test,"Expression of the genes for insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), IGF-II, and IGF-binding proteins-1 and -2 in fetal rat under conditions of intrauterine growth retardation caused by maternal fasting.  Evidence suggests that insulin-like growth factors-I and -II (IGF-I and II) play a role in regulating fetal growth and development.  In the fetus, IGF-I and -II are complexed with two specific binding proteins (IGFBP-1 and -2), which are thought to modulate the actions of the IGFs in target tissues.  We examined regulation of the genes for IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-1, and IGFBP-2 in fetal rat liver in an experimental model for intrauterine growth retardation caused by maternal fasting on days 17-21 of gestation.  The mean weight of fetuses from the fasted dams was 27-32% lower than the mean weight of fetuses from the fed dams.  The concentration of immunoreactive IGF-I was decreased by 71% in serum of fetuses from the fasting dams.  The concentration of immunoreactive IGF-II was slightly decreased (by 12%) in serum of fetuses from the fasting dams, whereas the concentration of immunoreactive pro-IGF-II E-domain peptide was decreased by 31%.  The abundance of hepatic IGF-I mRNA was decreased by 55% in fetuses from the fasting dams.  In contrast, the abundance of IGF-II mRNA in fetal liver was not significantly decreased by maternal fasting.  Maternal fasting caused a 2-fold increase in the abundance of IGFBP-1 mRNA in fetal liver, whereas it did not change the abundance of IGFBP-2 mRNA.  The induction of IGFBP-1 mRNA in liver of the growth-retarded fetuses is similar to the induction that occurs in liver of fasting adults, while the lack of regulation of IGFBP-2 mRNA differs from the strong induction of IGFBP-2 mRNA that occurs in liver of fasting adults.  In summary, these results indicate that maternal fasting causes a decrease in fetal IGF-I gene expression, a decrease in fetal serum IGF-I, and a slight decrease in fetal serum IGF-II and pro-IGF-II E-domain peptide concentrations.  Maternal fasting also causes an increase in fetal IGFBP-1 gene expression.  Changes in fetal insulin and glucose may be related to changes in expression of the IGF-I and IGFBP-1 genes in the growth-retarded fetuses.  The decreased expression of IGF-I and -II and increased expression of the IGFBP-1 gene may contribute to the fetal growth retardation observed in this model system."

Ohsumed,3124,test,"Two types of abnormal genes for plasminogen in families with a predisposition for thrombosis [published erratum appears in Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1991 Apr 1;88(7):2967]  The gene coding for plasminogen has been compared with several abnormal genes from Japanese patients by the polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequence analysis.  Two types of abnormal genes coding for plasminogen were identified in these patients.  In the type I mutation, a guanosine in GCT coding for Ala-601 near the active-site histidine was replaced by an adenosine resulting in ACT coding for threonine.  This mutation was also shown by the loss of a cleavage site for Fnu4HI endonuclease, a restriction enzyme that recognizes GCTGC but not ACTGC.  In the type II mutation, a guanosine in GTC coding for Val-355 was replaced by a thymidine resulting in TTC coding for phenylalanine.  This change was readily shown by digestion with Ava II endonuclease, a restriction enzyme that recognizes GGTCC and not GTTCC.  The type I mutation has been found to be identical to a plasminogen variant identified in Japanese patients by amino acid sequence analysis and also detected by isoelectric focusing, whereas the type II mutation is a unique amino acid substitution in the connecting region between the third and fourth kringles in plasminogen.  DNA sequence analysis also revealed that the abnormal genes carry several silent nucleotide substitutions located primarily within introns and 5' and 3' flanking regions."

Controlled perforations in guinea pig tympanic membranes were treated with fat myringoplasties, paper patches, or no intervention.  Four weeks following the procedures, ears were examined and photographed under the microscope and studied histologically.

Ohsumed,2740,test,"Concomitant iron and aluminum mass transfer following deferoxamine infusion during hemofiltration.  Variable tissue overloading can alter the removal rate of iron and aluminum from uremics.  Owing to its higher affinity to deferoxamine (DFO) and higher plasma concentrations, Fe could impair Al removal in cases of simultaneous body burden.  Fe and Al plasma kinetics and mass transfer were therefore studied in 12 uremic patients with different Fe and Al status: six with normal ferritin levels (less than 400 micrograms/L [ng/mL]), and Al 1.4 to 4.7 mumol/L (40 to 131 micrograms/L) (group A); six with increased ferritin (greater than 2,000 micrograms/L), and Al 1.7 to 17 mumol/L (47 to 476 micrograms/L) (group B).  DFO (40 and 80 mg/kg in a random sequence) was administered once a week during the first hour of the first hemofiltration (HF).  The results show that in both groups and with both DFO doses, maximum Fe and Al mass transfer was achieved in the first and second HF, respectively.  The 80-mg/kg dose of DFO significantly raised Al mass transfer in both groups, whereas Fe mass transfer was only slightly affected.  Even though plasma Fe levels were almost always higher than Al, Al mass transfer eventually exceeded that of Fe, in both Fe-normal and Fe-overload patients.  The bias towards Al in mass transfer was enhanced in both groups in the second HF, and at the higher DFO doses.  Thus, DFO once a week reduced Fe loss to less than 30 mumol/wk in patients with normal ferritin levels.  In both Fe and Al overloaded patients, Al can be removed, and Al mass transfer may often exceed Fe mass transfer, depending on the degree of tissue burden, the time from DFO infusion, and the DFO dose."
IMDb-top_1000,105,validation,"I have to admit that when I first heard about the Apocalypse film it was a worry.<br /><br />I mean, they have a lot to live up to, don't they? When they first did a stage show they won the Perrier award and when they did radio they won a Sony award. When they ventured onto our telly's they won a Bafta award, a Royal Television Society Award and the Golden Rose of Montreux.<br /><br />When the first series aired in January 1999 it was mind-blowing! A real breath of fresh air in British Comedy, and when the second series aired a year later it built on that foundation and sealed the shows cult status around the world, our web stats show that we have received visitors from every single country on the planet! The 'Local show for Local People' showcased the Gents talent for live performance and opened doors for the gents to do more live performing such as 'Art' in the west end.<br /><br />The fans favourite has always been the Christmas Special, less of a sketch show and more a tribute to classic horror films yet still wrapped up in the delicious League style.<br /><br />And then of course there was the 'difficult' third series, still a hit with the loyal hardcore fans of course, but maybe a little bit ahead of its time for a mainstream TV audience.<br /><br />As I say, a lot to live up to.<br /><br />So now we have the film and...Well a film is different isn't it? It will be seen by much larger numbers than the radio or TV shows and with the third series in mind I was worried.<br /><br />Well as you know I was lucky enough to get to see the film yesterday at a press screening in London and all my doubts were blown away (literally) in the first few minutes! I am not going to give plot lines away as some reviewers have done, nor am I going to tell you the catch phrases (although there is really only one) but I will try to tell you what they have managed to achieve with this film! Leaving the cinema on Monday night I could only imagine writing 'Oh my god, it's brilliant, its amazing, its the best thing they have ever done, better than the first, second and specials all rolled into one!' Of course I owe my visitors a much better explanation than that! So, why is it brilliant? This is a film for everyone, the casual fan, the obsessive fan the occasional fan and even for someone who is sat in the wrong cinema! You don't have to have watched the series to enjoy this film; it works on so many levels.<br /><br />This film reminded me why I am a League of Gentlemen Fan! You can tell that filming was a true labour of love too; the attention to detail is incredible. The sets for the TV show were always detailed but I am going to have to watch the film again just to look at the background! The story moves at a swift pace, the action carrying us from Royston Vasey to the real world where we meet the 'Creators' who are of course the League themselves! Along the way we manage to bump into favourite characters from the show but always within the central story unlike the TV sketch show.<br /><br />I was glad that the film was dark in places, a little scary and a little strange...only fitting for The League of Gentlemen. The Gents also managed to get their revenge on the BBC censors, not as much slipping in the word 'Mongoloid' as screaming it from the roof tops! Some may think the Gents portrayal of themselves a little indulgent but that's the joke and with that comes my only worry, the in jokes I mention below may puzzle some viewers and they might come over a little too clever...but I shouldn't worry, there is always a poo joke waiting just around the corner and speaking of jokes, they come thick and fast, and in a mixture of clever references, wig jokes, bum jokes, visual jokes and cock gags! I haven't laughed out loud in a cinema since...well, I can't remember! The fans that have been 'with' the League since the beginning are rewarded with loads of 'in' jokes, some that work on two levels, a mainstream audience may laugh at a reference to a compact disc for one reason whilst fans of the Local show will laugh for another reason altogether! The cameos are genius! Peter Kay and Simon Pegg form the strangest double act you have ever seen, Simon getting one of the films biggest laughs just by making a noise! I was a little worried about the 1690's aspect of the film when I first heard about it but as a story within a story I was just getting into it when...but that would be telling! All I need to say is that it fits wonderfully and adds to the overall feel of the film! I am not a professional reviewer of films, so I am finding it difficult to put into words how much I enjoyed this film but for now I will just say that if the supposed benchmark for British Comedy films in recent years was the excellent 'Shaun of the Dead' then I am sorry but a new benchmark has just been set by the inventive, hilarious and sometimes a little scary...The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse.<br /><br />Jason Kenny 2005"

The reactivities of this antibody with various human glioma tissues and cultured glioma cells and the characterization of the antigen recognized by CLN-IgG on malignant glioma cells were analyzed and reported.  CLN-IgG reacted with various human glioma cells and glioma tissues, especially glioblastoma, but did not react with normal brain tissues or fetal brain tissues.  A large amount of antigen recognized by CLN-IgG was expressed on cell membranes of undifferentiated glioma cells and of glioma cells at the G2/M tumor growth phase in cycling cells.  Antigen recognized by CLN-IgG was detected in only one of seven samples of cyst fluid, and was not detected in 27 serum samples or 18 samples of cerebrospinal fluid from glioma patients.

Western hemisphere and Eastern Hemisphere strains differed by the size of a single EcoRI fragment carrying the Shiga toxin genes.  Three ribosomal DNA (rDNA) patterns were observed, which correlated with the strain's continental origin for 81 of 83 isolates tested.  Together the Shiga toxin and rDNA probe results indicated that recent Mexican isolates were chromosomally similar to earlier Central American isolates and distinct from Asian and African strains.  This suggests there has been no significant exchange of organisms between continents in recent decades and that the 1988 outbreak in Mexico was caused by strains present in Central America since at least 1962."
IMDb-top_1000,50,validation,"You don't review James Bond movies, you evaluate them, rate them according to how well they meet expectations. There are certain things one has come to expect, even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film. And even though NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is not technically part of the official Bond filmography, the mere presence of Sean Connery returning as 007 makes it something more than merely an honorary member of the series. Anyway, here's how it rates on a scale of 1 to 10: <br /><br />Title: NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN: The clever title has no apparent link to the actual storyline, but is instead an in-joke reference to Sean Connery's vow to never play OO7 again after having been lured back once before for DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER. Whatever the case, it is a catchy title. 8 points.<br /><br />Pre-Credit Teaser: Perhaps trying to avoid any obvious parallels to the official EON series of Bond films, there is no Teaser; the opening scenes are just shown behind the credits. And even that is disappointing: yet another ""oh-no, Bond has been killed"" fakeout. 4 points.<br /><br />Opening Credits: Other than a screen full of tiny 007's, they didn't even bother trying to jazz up the credits with graphics or split screens or interesting camera angles. 1 points.<br /><br />Theme Song: As written by Michel LeGrand and sung by Lani Hall ""Never Say Never Again"" would make for a perfectly pleasant part of a particularly long elevator ride. As a Bond theme, it's merely okay. 6 points.<br /><br />""Bond, James Bond"": Appropriately, since this film sees Connery being lured back into service as Bond after a decade's hiatus, the story begins with 007 facing the question as to whether Bond/Connery is still up to the job. Happily, Connery more than proves himself ready for Bondage again. Though he is a bit grayer, sporting a bit more girth and wearing a slightly more obvious toupee, he seems to have no trouble slipping back into action. All in all, it is one of Connery's best, and most relaxed, turns as the character. 9 points.<br /><br />Bond Babes: Even in the best of the Bond films, the female characters aren't given much dimension; they exist largely as necessary props for Bond's use. Future Oscar-winner Kim Basinger is granted a great deal of leeway in creating her character of Domino Petachi and the film benefits from this. She does a nice job -- and she's not bad to look at either. 8 points.<br /><br />Bond Villain: The reports of his death being obviously exaggerated, Blofeld is back -- at least, for the moment -- showing he has more lives than his prized pussycat. One-time Jesus portrayer-turned-stereotypical villain, Max von Sydow isn't given a lot to do in the role, but is a silky presence nonetheless. But he is overshadowed by a wonderful performance by Klaus Maria Brandauer as Maximilian Largo. After a string of banal Bond villains, it is so refreshing for Brandauer to gave a performance that is both subtle, yet colorfully evil. Funny without being campy, ruthless without seeming cartoonish; his Largo ranks right up there with Auric Goldfinger as one of Bond's best villains. 10 points.<br /><br />Bond Baddies: Fatima Blush! What can I say? As played with all the bold style of a particularly flamboyant drag queen, Barbara Carrera breezes through the film, displaying a mix of self-amused evil and more than a tad of pure psychotic insanity. Bond has crossed paths with a variety of femmes fatales, most of whom have been so easily disposed of that they existed more as amusing eye candy than as characters. But few dared to exhibit such a flare for the dramatic or such fierce determination. Even her untimely demise is spectacular, even by Bondian standards. 10 points.<br /><br />Sinister Plot: As a remake of sorts of THUNDERBALL, the film does seem a bit been-there-done-that: nuclear missiles are stolen and major real estate will go kaboom if all the countries of the world don't pay a multi-kazillion dollar ransom. But at least producer Kevin McClory was lucky enough to find himself forced to remake one of the weakest Bond adventures. By comparisons, this effort blows THUNDERBALL out of the water. And despite the absence of many Bondian trademarks, the film succeeds on its own. 9 points.<br /><br />Production values: The film starts out with an uneasy style, like a TV movie trying to be more than it can. But as the story progress, the film gains momentum and a sense of purpose, making it a superior adventure. 8 points. <br /><br />Bonus Points: There are several odd changes that sets this Bond film apart from the official series. Miss Moneypenny is hardly acknowledged; as played by Edward Fox, ""M"" is a cranky old grouch with no respect for the ""Double Os,"" a foreshadowing of how Judi Dench would later play the part; and ""Q"" suddenly has a cockney accent and is all buddy-buddy with Bond. And there is a curious sense of nostalgia throughout the film, such as replacing Bond's Astin-Martin with a vintage Packard and a tango dance number that is cleverly inserted into the story. And a big rescue near the end is on horseback, an homage to THE RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, which was itself a tribute to the Bond films. 5 points.<br /><br />Summary: NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is a mixed bag. In the really important areas, it more than holds it own thanks to hero Connery, villain Brandauer, assassin Carrera and damsel-in-distress Basinger. But the devil is in the details; as seemingly unimportant as the opening credits, theme song and such seem, the film is lacking because of their absence. It all comes off as a faux Bond film; a very good substitute, but a substitute nonetheless.<br /><br />Bond-o-meter Rating: 78 points out of 100."

Ohsumed,1390,test,"Characterization of auscultatory gaps with wideband external pulse recording.  Three types of auscultatory gaps, called G1, G2, and G3, that occur during blood pressure measurement have been identified by using wideband external pulse recording.  We have previously shown that the wideband external pulse recorded during cuff deflation can be separated into three components (K1, K2, and K3), one of which (K2) is closely related to the Korotkoff sound.  G1 occurs with cuff pressure just below systolic and is characterized by the presence of K1 and K2 with intermittent disappearance of K2.  G1 gaps are related to a phasic decrease of arterial (systolic) pressure and were exhibited by 13 of 60 hypertensive patients.  G2 gaps are related to a phasic increase of arterial (diastolic) pressure, occur when cuff pressure is just above diastolic, and are characterized by the presence of K1, K2, and K3 with intermittent disappearance of K2.  Seven of 60 hypertensive patients exhibited a G2 gap.  G3 gaps occur with cuff pressure between systolic and diastolic and are characterized by an underdeveloped or blunted K2 signal.  Three of 60 hypertensive patients exhibited a G3 gap.

The emergence of laparoscopic cholecystectomy as a viable alternative to traditional cholecystectomy has been greeted with enthusiasm by the surgical community.  This new technique is not without complications, both potential and real.  The complications associated with diagnostic laparoscopy are well documented, as are those associated with traditional cholecystectomy.  All of these may also be seen with laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  The incidence of their occurrence, however, may vary.  It remains too early to evaluate the complication rates from this new procedure, as reports of large series are just beginning to emerge.  Early reports are encouraging but caution that bile duct injury, hemorrhage, and even death may occur.  Early enthusiasm for this new method must be tempered with care in its practice if complication rates are to be maintained at an acceptable level and the procedure is to earn a permanent place in the armamentarium of the surgeon."

Ohsumed,987,test,"Local control of auricular, periauricular, and external canal cutaneous malignancies with Mohs surgery.  Three hundred ninety-seven patients with 407 cutaneous malignancies of the auricle, periauricular region, and cartilaginous external ear canal were reviewed.  Tumors were most commonly located in the preauricular and postauricular regions, followed by the helix, concha, antihelix, and ear canal.  All lesions were excised with Mohs microscopic control of margins.  For lesions requiring lateral temporal bone resection, an adaptation of fresh-tissue microscopic control was used to analyze deep and anterior margins suspected of harboring residual tumor.  Two-year minimum follow-up of 229 patients with periauricular and auricular tumors (N = 231 tumors) and 14 patients with cartilaginous ear canal tumors (N = 14 tumors) revealed recurrence rates of 6.9% and 14.3%, respectively.  Recurrences were most common in cases of large tumors (greater than 2.5 cm), basal cell carcinomas with morphea elements, and multiply recurrent lesions.  We conclude that Mohs surgery is comparatively effective, though not uniformly curative, and can be adapted to supplement excision of large tumors in these regions."
Ohsumed,2658,test,"A mathematical model of the volume, pH, and ion content regulation in reticulocytes. Application to the pathophysiology of sickle cell dehydration.  We developed a mathematical model of the reticulocyte, seeking to explain how a cell with similar volume but much higher ionic traffic than the mature red cell (RBC) regulates its volume, pH, and ion content in physiological and abnormal conditions.  Analysis of the fluxbalance required by reticulocytes to conserve volume and composition predicted the existence of previously unsuspected Na(+)-dependent Cl- entry mechanisms.  Unlike mature RBCs, reticulocytes did not tend to return to their original state after brief perturbations.  The model predicted hysteresis and drift in cell pH, volume, and ion contents after transient alterations in membrane permeability or medium composition; irreversible cell dehydration could thus occur by brief K+ permeabilization, transient medium acidification, or the replacement of external Na+ with an impermeant cation.  Both the hysteresis and drift after perturbations were shown to depend on the pHi dependence of the K:Cl cotransport, a major reticulocyte transporter.  This behavior suggested a novel mechanism for the generation of irreversibly sickled cells directly from reticulocytes, rather than in a stepwise, progressive manner from discocytes.  Experimental tests of the model's predictions and the hypothesis are described in the following paper."

Ohsumed,3682,test,"Intensive insulin therapy for treatment of type I diabetes.  Intensive insulin therapy is best defined as a comprehensive system of diabetes management with the patient and management team as partners.  The system is directed at improvement of glycemia and patient well-being.  Glycemic targets should be individually defined.  Frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose, probably at least four times per day, is essential for meticulous control.  The benefits include improved psychosocial functioning and the potential of lessening the risks of chronic complications of diabetes.  The risks relate to problems associated with hypoglycemia, which are increased if meticulous glycemic control is sought.  One of the important elements of intensive therapy is a multiple-component insulin program designed to provide effective insulinemia coinciding with each major meal and continuous basal insulinemia throughout the 24-h day.  This may be achieved with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) or multiple injections with various insulin regimens, although CSII may offer real advantages in terms of the pharmacokinetics of insulin delivery.  Other pharmacokinetic issues to be considered involve selection of injection sites, timing of premeal insulin, and mixing insulins.  Many studies have shown that, albeit with effort, excellent glycemic control can be achieved by various intensive insulin-therapy regimens.  The implementation of a program of intensive therapy involves patient self-management in terms of altering insulin dosages, food intake, and/or activity in an attempt to achieve the target level of glycemia selected.  In motivated patients willing to embark on such a course of therapy, intensive insulin therapy can be worthwhile.  It should be considered for all patients with type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus."

Ohsumed,1382,test,"A possible role for vitamins C and E in cataract prevention.  Biochemical evidence suggests that oxidative stress caused by accumulation of free radicals is involved in the pathogenesis of senile cataracts.  If so, appropriate amounts of the antioxidant vitamins C and E might be expected to prevent or retard the process.  Such activity has been observed in several in vitro and in vivo studies of experimentally-induced cataracts.  A recent epidemiologic study found that cataract patients tended to have lower serum levels of vitamins C, E, or carotenoids than did control subjects.  The present investigation, which compared the self-reported consumption of supplementary vitamins by 175 cataract patients with that of 175 individually matched, cataract-free subjects, revealed that the latter group used significantly more supplementary vitamins C and E (P = 0.01 and 0.004, respectively).  Because the results suggested a reduction in the risk of cataracts of at least 50%, a randomized, controlled trial of vitamin supplementation in cataract prevention may be warranted."
Ohsumed,2510,test,"The clinical efficacy of triple-injection wrist arthrography.  Triple-injection wrist arthrography has been demonstrated to increase the likelihood that all the ligamentous perforations in an injured wrist will be diagnosed.  However, compared with imaging after single injection of contrast material into the radiocarpal joint, triple-injection arthrography not only increases patient expense but also significantly increases the time required of both patients and arthrographers to obtain the diagnosis.  With the goal of decreasing the number of triple injections, the author reviewed 50 consecutive triple-injection wrist arthrograms.  Using a technique based on high-volume injection of contrast material to achieve complete distention of the joint, the author achieved a false-negative rate for demonstration of complete perforations with radiocarpal injection alone of only 2% (10% if partial perforations were included).  In none of these cases was patient treatment altered by the additional information provided by the second and third injections.  This false-negative rate is significantly lower than that reported previously and raises the question of whether there are circumstances in which the easier and less time-consuming single radiocarpal injection might be appropriate."

IMDb-top_1000,242,test,"Even a decade after ""Frontline"" aired on the ABC, near as I can tell, ""current affairs"" programmes are still using the same tricks over and over. Time after time, ""Today Tonight"" and ""A Current Affair"" are seen to be hiding behind the facade of journalistic professionalism, and yet they feed us nothing but tired stories about weight-loss and dodgy tradesmen, shameless network promotions and pointless celebrity puff-pieces. Having often been subjected to that entertainment-less void between 'The Simpsons' at 6:00 PM and 'Sale of the Century' (or 'Temptation') at 7:00 PM, I was all too aware of the little tricks that these shows would use to attract ratings.<br /><br />Fortunately, four rising comedians  Rob Sitch, Jane Kennedy, Santo Cilauro and Tom Gleisner  were also all too aware of all this, and they crafted their frustrations into one of the most wickedly-hilarious media satires you'll ever see on television. The four entertainers had already met with comedic success, their previous most memorable television stint being on 'The Late Show,' the brilliant Saturday night variety show which ran for two seasons from 1992-1993, and also featured fellow comedians Mick Molloy, Tony Martin, Jason Stephens and Judith Lucy.<br /><br />""Frontline"" boasts an ensemble of colourful characters, each with their own distinct and quirky personality. The current-affairs show is headed by nicely-groomed Mike Moore (Rob Sitch), an ambitious, pretentious, dim-witted narcissist. Mike works under the delusion that the show is serving a vital role for society  he is always adamant that they ""maintain their journalistic integrity""  and his executive producers have excelled into getting him to believe just that. Mike is basically a puppet to bring the news to the people; occasionally he gets the inkling that he is being led along by the nose, but usually this thought is stamped out via appeals to his vanity or promises of a promotion.<br /><br />Brooke Vandenberg (Jane Kennedy) is the senior female reporter on the show. She is constantly concerned about her looks and public profile, and, if the rumours are to be believed, she has had a romantic liaison with just about every male celebrity in existence. Another equally amoral reporter, Marty Di Stasio, is portrayed by Tiriel Mora, who memorably played inept solicitor Dennis Denuto in the Australian comedy classic, 'The Castle.' Emma Ward (Alison Whyte) is the Line Producer on the show, and the single shining beacon of morality on the ""Frontline"" set. Then there's the highly-amusing weatherman, Geoffrey Salter (Santo Cilauro), Mike's best friend and confidant. Geoff makes a living out of always agreeing with Mike's opinion, and of laughing uproariously at his jokes before admitting that he doesn't get them.<br /><br />For each of the shows three seasons, we are treated to a different EP, Executive Producer. Brian Thompson (Bruno Lawrence), who unfortunately passed away in 1995, runs the programme during Season 1. He has a decent set of morals, and is always civil to his employees, and yet is more-than-willing to cast these aside in favour of high ratings. Sam Murphy (Kevin J. Wilson) arrives on set in Season 2, a hard-nosed, smooth-talking producer who knows exactly how to string Mike along; the last episode of the second season, when Mike finally gets the better of him, is a classic moment. Graeme ""Prowsey"" Prowse (Steve Bisley), EP for the third season, is crude, unpleasant and unashamedly sexist. It's, therefore, remarkable that you eventually come to like him.<br /><br />With its cast of distinctive, exaggerated characters, ""Frontline"" has a lot of fun satirising current-affairs programmes and their dubious methods for winning ratings. Many of the episodes were shot quickly and cheaply, often implementing many plot ideas from recent real-life situations, but this never really detracts from the show's topicality ten years on. Celebrity cameos come in abundance, with some of the most memorable appearances including Pauline Hanson, Don Burke and Jon English. Watch out for Harry Shearer's hilarious appearance in the Season 2 episode ""Changing the Face of Current Affairs,"" playing Larry Hadges, an American hired by the network to reform the show.<br /><br />Particularly in the third season, I noticed that ""Frontline"" boasted an extremely gritty form of black humour, uncharacteristic for such a light-hearted comedy show. Genuinely funny moments are born from Brooke being surreptitiously bribed into having an abortion, murder by a crazed gunman and Mike treacherously betraying his best friend's hopes and dreams, only to be told that he is a good friend. The series' final minute  minus an added-scene during the credits, which was probably added just in case a fourth season was to be produced  was probably the greatest, blackest ending to a comedy series that I've yet seen.<br /><br />Below is listed a very tentative list of my top five favourite ""Frontline"" episodes, but, make no mistake, every single half-hour is absolutely hilarious and hard-hitting satire.<br /><br />1) ""The Siege"" (Season 1)<br /><br />2) ""Give 'em Enough Rope"" (Season 2)<br /><br />3) ""Addicted to Fame"" (Season 3)<br /><br />4) ""Basic Instincts"" (Season 2)<br /><br />5) ""Add Sex and Stir"" (Season 1)"

Ohsumed,2289,test,"Osteoid osteoma of the scapula. A case report and review of the literature.  The scapula is a rare location for osteoid osteoma, which in most cases does not involve the flat bones.  The en bloc excision in this uncommon location can be problematic since the surgical exposure is difficult, and shoulder joint function can be affected if the lesion is subchondral.  In an 18-year-old man, an osteoid osteoma was located in the subchondral area of the glenoid.  A guided needle biopsy of the nidus resulted in complete healing.  This mode of treatment, with proper follow-up examination, is acceptable for a benign lesion situated in a problematic location."
Ohsumed,5,test,"Fibrin formation on vessel walls in hyperplastic and malignant prostate tissue.  To explore mechanisms of coagulation activation in adenocarcinoma of the prostate, the occurrence and distribution of components of coagulation and fibrinolysis pathways in situ were studied by means of immunohistochemical techniques applied to frozen sections of fresh malignant and benign hyperplastic prostatic tissue obtained at transurethral resection.  Fibrinogen was distributed throughout the perivascular and tumor connective tissue in both malignant and benign disease but was not present in adjacent areas of normal prostate.  Antibodies specific for fibrin and D-dimer crosslink sites stained vascular endothelium focally in both malignant and benign tissues.  Both neoplastic cells and benign hyperplastic glandular epithelial cells stained weakly and in a patchy distribution for tissue factor and focally for low-molecular-weight urokinase-type plasminogen activator.  Focal staining of vascular endothelium was also observed for tissue plasminogen activator and plasmin-antiplasmin complex neoantigen.  By contrast, no tissue staining was observed for factor VII, factor X, factor XIII ""a"" subunit, high-molecular-weight urokinase-type plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitors 1 to 3, protein C, and protein S.  Thus, the similarity in findings between benign hyperplastic and neoplastic prostate tissue, the lack of either an intact tumor cell-associated coagulation pathway or fibrin formation, and the presence of fibrin on vascular endothelium are consistent with the concept that coagulation activation in prostatic cancer may not be due to a direct effect of the tumor cells on the clotting mechanism.  Rather, such activation may be induced by a soluble tumor product that activates procoagulant activity on certain host (for example, vascular endothelial) cells.  These findings, together with the lack of effect of warfarin anticoagulation on the clinical course of patients with prostatic cancer, contrast with findings in certain other tumor types and suggest that coagulation activation may not contribute to progression of adenocarcinoma of the prostate."

Ohsumed,551,validation,"Estrogen replacement and coronary artery disease. Effect on survival in postmenopausal women.  The relationship among postmenopausal estrogen use, coronary stenosis, and survival was examined retrospectively in 2268 women undergoing coronary angiography.  The patients were selected for study if their age was 55 years or older at the time of angiography or if they had previously undergone bilateral oophorectomy.  Postmenopausal estrogen use in 1178 patients with coronary artery disease (greater than 70% stenosis) and 644 patients with mild to moderate coronary artery disease (5% to 69% stenosis) was compared with 446 control subjects (0% stenosis) using life-table analysis.  Over 10 years of follow-up, there was no significant difference in survival among patients initially free of coronary lesions on arteriography who had either never used (377) or ever used (69) estrogens.  Among patients with mild to moderate coronary stenosis, 10-year survival of those who had never used estrogens was 85.0% and it was 95.6% among 99 ""ever users."" Survival was 60.0% among those with more than 70% coronary stenosis who had never used estrogen and it was 97.0% among 70 ever users.  The ""never users"" group were older (65 vs 59 years), had a lower proportion of cigarette smokers (40% vs 57.1%), a higher proportion of subjects with diabetes (21.7% vs 12.9%) and hyperlipidemia (58% vs 44%), and approximately equal numbers of hypertensives (56.0% vs 54.3%).  Cox's proportional hazards model was used to estimate survival as a function of multiple covariables.  Estrogen use was found to have a significant, independent effect on survival in women.  We conclude that estrogen replacement after menopause prolongs survival when coronary artery disease is present, but it has less effect in the absence of coronary artery disease."
Ohsumed,359,test,"Comparison of the effects of guanadrel sulfate and propranolol on blood pressure, functional capacity, serum lipoproteins and glucose in systemic hypertension.  In a controlled, double-blind, crossover study, the effects of guanadrel sulfate and propranolol on blood pressure (BP) and selected cardiopulmonary and metabolic variables were compared in 15 physically active and moderately hypertensive subjects.  Guanadrel sulfate reduced systolic and diastolic BP at rest by -16 and -15 mm Hg, and at maximal exercise by -33 and -13 mm Hg, respectively (p less than 0.005), without affecting submaximal oxygen consumption (VO2), maximal VO2, ventilatory threshold, forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, or fatigue, as assessed by perceived exertion.  In contrast, propranolol significantly decreased diastolic BP at rest (-16 mm Hg) and systolic BP at maximal exercise (-44 mm Hg); however, it significantly decreased submaximal VO2 (-3.9 ml.kg-1.min-1), maximal VO2 (-3.9 ml.kg-1.min-1), ventilatory threshold (-0.3 liters.min-1), minute ventilation at submaximal exercise (-7.3 liters.min-1), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (-0.27 liters), and concomitantly increased the rating of perceived exertion at maximal exercise (1.9 U).  Guanadrel sulfate was also associated with significant decreases in mean fasting plasma glucose and total serum cholesterol, whereas propranolol resulted in an increase in serum triglycerides (p less than 0.05).  In contrast to propranolol, guanadrel sulfate appears to decrease BP without evoking negative metabolic consequences or impairing exercise tolerance."

Two different methods for evaluating platelet antibody were used to study 12 normal subjects and 24 patients consisting primarily of intravenous drug users (IVDUs) who were positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).  Total platelet-associated immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) were measured by enzyme-lined immunosorbent assay on platelet lysate, and platelet surface-associated IgG and IgM were measured by semiquantitative flow cytometry.  IgG and IgM values showed significant correlations between the two measurement methods.  Mean platelet surface IgG and total IgG were 3.6 and 4.3 times greater, respectively, in IVDUs than in controls, and platelet IgM was also significantly higher in IVDUs than in controls as measured by both techniques.  Although mean platelet immunoglobulin levels were higher in the IVDUs with thrombocytopenia than in IVDUs with normal platelet counts, these differences did not achieve significance.  These data show that platelet IgG and IgM levels are increased in IVDU-associated HIV infection and suggest that these increases are not confined to patients manifesting thrombocytopenia.  The herein described platelet surface antibody and total platelet antibody measurements appear to be equally useful in studying this patient population.  Specific details for generating platelet-associated immunofluorescence units are discussed."
IMDb-top_1000,263,test,"A group of friends receive word from a pal who has found gold in an old mind shaft nearby an ancient abandoned western town of Suttersville. Despite warnings by the local sheriff, Murphy(John Phillip Law), Old Man Prichard(Richard Lynch)a bedraggled hick who swindles tourists with supposed collectible Wanted posters, and kooky superstitious Aunt Nelly(Karen Black)to stay out of the mine due to it's notorious legend(..that an evil coal miner who sold his soul to devil and murdered a priest's(Jeff Conaway)daughter will return from the dead to kill those who remove the gold from his shaft), these people only see the green, not the blood red which could potentially ooze from their slain bodies. Finding the gold of Jeremiah Stone intact, they line their pockets and carrying cases, prepared for the bright futures that supposedly lie ahead. But, when you do not heed the warnings of those you consider backwoods loons, the obvious result will be gruesome death. Jeremiah Stone, as we see, is lying merely a skeleton near an alter containing skulls lined next to each other as the candles on top of them light up, the pickax underneath awaiting it's master, with dust particles returning him to a grotesque corpse with demonic exposition, his eyes aglow with wrath. This hapless group, hoping for some fun around the campfire with gold providing them with warm prospects for life ahead, will fall prey to the vengeful ghoul and his mean pickax. Another victim will meet the nasty end of a shovel thrown through the windshield of her vehicle, directing it's path straight into her neck. Another failed attempt to retreat has Stone causing a frightened victim to drive his car into a tree, his body engulfed in flames as he fails to escape without harm. Another, a local girl searching for her new friends, worried about their well being, receives the pickax buried into her stomach. Aunt Nelly informs those still alive about the Forty-Niner and the curse on those who raids his eternal stash..and pays the price for relating such information. Will anybody survive? Or, is the entire group fated to perish at the hands of the zombie miner?<br /><br />Make-up effects artist and monster creator, John Carl Buechler directs this supernatural slasher without worrying about logic or strong story-telling, opting instead to allow his zombie miner to destroy anyone and everyone who happens to be in his path. He provides just enough back story, and this is feeble at best, for the killer allowing special guest star, Karen Black(..oh how her career has sunken into the abyss)to explain to the viewer about him. The story given to us has the miner holding a priest's daughter hostage, threatening to execute her as the Suttersville authorities warn against such an action. Startling enough, Stone plants that pickax right into her back, with the opposition unloading their guns with little effect because he sold his soul to Satan. Retreating to his domain, the mine shaft, Stone sends out a warning against anyone even attempting to take what's his, the loot. Typical of most slashers in general, this bunch of twenty-somethings are your garden variety victims, with little development other than some banter and exchanging of words provides as filler until the undead maniac pops onto the scene to slaughter them. They are the usual group, from the city, trespassing unto unfamiliar territory, resurrecting an evil that should remain dormant. Like many of the later 80's slashers, a good deal of the violence is off-screen. What is on screen, the minimal gore, is rather mundanely presented and happens rather quickly. The ghoul make-up for the killer is only shown occasionally;he's mostly shrouded in darkness, the victims' horrified faces as he catches or chases after them are given more credence than the method of destruction. One thing's for certain, stunt men were set on fire many times. At least three times, a character is burned alive by either a lantern or flaming vehicle. Martin Cove has a minor cameo as Black's former husband, Caleb, now living with a much younger, and dense, honey. Vernon Wells(..of The Road Warrior and Commando fame)has the back story role of Jeremiah Stone as a human, still capturing the same type of menace he specializes in. John Phillip Law seems to be enjoying himself as the rather polite and hospitable sheriff, welcoming the outsiders to his neck of the woods. Buechler has quite an attractive cast of actresses, all wearing tight pants and smallish shirts, showing off their sleek and athletic figures, especially Elina Madison as easy-lay Roxann, always willing to remove her clothes for greedy jerk, Hayden(Rick Majeske). Stephen Wastell(The Ghosts of Edendale) is Axl, a rather clumsy foil, used as a butt of many jokes including his ""dump in the woods"" scene and current unemployment status."

This report evaluates the long-term in vivo blood compatibility of these heparin immobilized surfaces.  Vascular grafts (6 mm ID, 7 cm in length) were fabricated with Biomer, and heparin was immobilized in situ with PEO spacers (B-PEO4K) and coated on their luminal surfaces with PEO-PDMS-Hep.  Biomer and PEO (Mn = 4,000) grafted Biomer (B-PEO4K) were used as controls.  The grafts were implanted in the abdominal aorta of dogs and retrieved at 3 months or when graft occlusion was suspected.  Retrieved grafts were evaluated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).  TEM measured the thickness of the adsorbed protein layer on the surface and the protein distribution (albumin, fibrinogen, and IgG) visualized by an immunogold method.  All heparin immobilized grafts were patent at 3 months, whereas Biomer and B-PEO4K grafts occluded within 1 month.  SEM pictures of heparin immobilized surfaces after 3 months demonstrated minimal platelet adhesion and activation without detectable fibrin formation.  Heparin immobilized surfaces showed a thin protein layer (300-600 A) even after 3 months, with high concentrations of albumin and IgG and less fibrinogen."

IMDb-top_1000,75,validation,"This is a wonderful new movie currently still showing in cinemas in my country. Its director, the Calabrian Gianni Amelio, is in my humble view perhaps the only contemporary Italian director, along with Nanni Moretti, to deserve being called great (that is, apart from the old masters who're still around and occasionally still churning out movies). It's one of my greatest regrets that contemporary Italian cinema has been ailing since the mid-70s, mostly due to a dire lack of funding and nurturing of new talent, something which can be transferred to most fields and which makes Italy one of the most static industrialised countries of our time production-wise (both in an industrial and cultural sense)... unlike, say, China. And this, among other things, is precisely the subject of Amelio's latest movie. Few directors can speak to me about the true, present state of my country and the world as Amelio can, yet his pictures also have a precious timelessness and universality. And for those already worrying that they may be slow, ponderous and worthy - rest assured: of the ones I've seen they most certainly aren't, at least not if you're used to quality European cinema.<br /><br />The basic plot outline: Vincenzo Buonavolontà is a technician at an obsolete steel plant factory somewhere in Italy, probably the North. He is played by Sergio Castellitto, one of contemporary Italy's most versatile and talented actors. When a major Chinese steel company purchases some of the Italian steel plant's industrial machinery, Vincenzo, who struggles to make himself understood with the non-Italian speaking Chinese director, tries to tell him that the machine is defective and its converter needs substituting, an element he's working on custom-building himself. He warns them that not doing this might have very dangerous consequences. Meanwhile a young Chinese woman called Liu Hua acts as interpreter between the two men, but seems to struggle to find adequate translations for some of Vincenzo's technical jargon. The Italian eventually loses his patience with her, virtually pushing her aside and asking her to hand him the Chinese-Italian dictionary so that he can do the translating himself.<br /><br />Despite Vincenzo's warnings, the following morning he finds that the Chinese factory director and his employees have returned to their own country while not heeding his advice about the adequate use of the industrial machine at all. Thus Vincenzo, equipped with his great integrity, sets off for China. And here begins an endlessly fascinating road movie through China, a very topical 21st century Odyssey through the Asian Giant. A latter-day Marco Polo's quest for the secrets of the mysterious nation? Not quite. As in all of Amelio's movies, the journey itself becomes far more important than whether its ultimate ""mission"" is carried out or not. In fact, the way in which the point is literally brought home, not without a touch of humour, is a lovely, poignant paradox and irony, which made my eyes well up while I was simultaneously smiling. The spectator is let in on the secret that Vincenzo's trip was ultimately completely useless, but he himself doesn't know it, and goes home a satisfied man, a deluded innocent. At least, you figure, he's happy. Sort of.<br /><br />The journeys that Amelio's characters embark on totally uproots and strips them down to their bare, human essentials. They are momentarily without name, status or someone to put in a word for them. These Theo Angelopoulos-like themes are also explored in Lamerica, actually my favourite Amelio movie, closely followed by La stella che non c'è in order of personal preference. In the 1994 movie Lamerica, two Italian racketeers travel to Albania to ""do business"". Just like Vincenzo, they intend to go there, do what they have to do and then go back home. Instead, one of these two Italians accidentally ends up on an almost Homeric journey through this devastated land just after the fall of Communism.<br /><br />But let us go back to La stella che non c'è: once Vincenzo is in China, he predictably discovers that the seemingly ""simple"" task of handing the converter to its new owner is anything but straight-forward. The piece of machinery's new location is seemingly almost impossible to determine, unless he embarks on an arduous journey through China. When he comes across Liu Hua, the young interpreter he'd mistreated now working as a librarian, he tries to speak to her but she reacts in a hostile manner, informing him that because of him, she'd lost her job as interpreter back in Italy. Played by the relative newcomer Ling Tai, Liu Hua soon becomes a Virgil to Vincenzo's Dante when she grudgingly figures that she could do worse than to act as guide and interpreter for the Italian on his trip (obviously for a consistent sum of cash). This young Chinese actress may not have the beauty of Ziyi Zhang, nor the movie star glamour of Gong Li, but her charming, expressive and pretty face oozes a combination of defiant strength, intelligence, dignity and wry humour that'll make her features difficult to forget once you've seen the movie. Furthermore, she and Castellitto have wonderful emotional chemistry as co-stars.<br /><br />Amelio weaves dramas that are serious, poetic, mythical, post-neo-realist and humorous all at once, while maintaining a heart-warming ability to explore the fleeting essence of humanity in everyday, commonplace circumstances. A documentary-like naturalness conceals what is actually a meticulously conceived tapestry of faces and places, a vista which also manages to incorporate a cinematography of breath-taking beauty. The photography here is functional yet gorgeous, as befits a movie on the displaced in an industrial and emotional wasteland.<br /><br />Amelio's observant eye is a grown-up, disillusioned one, yet also never a cynical or misanthropic one. The masterful camera angles also often gives a sense of Vincenzo's alienness in the eyes of the Chinese, bringing home a sense of objectivity and cultural impartiality that's very rare in movies about a ""familiar"" Westerner exploring an ""unfamiliar"" non-Western country. I cannot recommend this movie enough."
Ohsumed,3453,test,"Double-blind randomized study of prolonged higher-dose oral amoxycillin in purulent bronchiectasis.  Thirty-eight patients with bronchiectasis and daily expectoration of purulent sputum despite conventional antibiotic courses were randomly allocated to receive a sachet of amoxycillin (3 g) or matched placebo twice daily for 32 weeks in a double-blind study.  Nine patients (four amoxycillin, five placebo) were withdrawn from the study treatment; the response of the two patients (both on amoxycillin) withdrawn within the first six weeks was not assessed.  The pretreatment characteristics of the two groups were similar.  Independent assessment of overall response based on patients' diary cards showed that a higher proportion improved in the amoxycillin group (11 of 17) than in the placebo group (four of 19; p = 0.02).  Patients in the amoxycillin group spent significantly less time confined to bed and away from work during treatment.  The frequency of exacerbations during the study treatment phase was similar in the two groups but they were less severe than before study treatment in the amoxycillin group.  There was a greater reduction in purulent sputum volume between exacerbations during the study treatment in the amoxycillin group to 20 per cent of pretreatment volume than in the placebo group (88 per cent of pretreatment volume, p = 0.008), although the concentrations of Haemophilus spp.  in sputum between exacerbations was similar in the two groups.  Adverse effects experienced were minor except in one patient (amoxycillin) withdrawn after developing a rash and in six patients (three amoxycillin, three placebo) who had diarrhoea lasting more than one week necessitating withdrawal of two patients (one amoxycillin, one placebo) from study treatment.  Sputum and stool cultures collected regularly during the study showed no important changes in the bacterial flora in either group.  Prolonged higher-dose antibiotic therapy in these patients with severe purulent bronchiectasis significantly reduced the host (patient) inflammatory response to colonizing microorganisms and reduced morbidity."
Ohsumed,2752,test,"The role of dose intensity in determining outcome in intermediate-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.  To determine whether the dose intensity of chemotherapeutic regimens correlates with the complete remission rate in adult patients with advanced-stage intermediate-grade lymphoma, reports of comparative trials of therapy were reviewed.  Reports were identified using MEDLINE, through references from review articles, and through review of selected abstracts.  Twenty-two studies including 14 randomized and eight cohort trials were analyzed to assess projected dose intensity.  Four other studies were analyzed to assess the role of received dose intensity.  Dose intensities were calculated using described methods and correlated with complete remission rates.  Individual trials were assessed using ""levels of evidence."" A metaanalysis of randomized trials and a cross-trial analysis of all comparative trials using a weighted least squares linear regression were performed.  Using levels of evidence, support was obtained for the hypothesis that dose intensity correlates with the remission rate from two trials in which dose intensity was ""indirectly"" tested.  As these studies did not ""directly"" test dose intensity, confounding variables, including those arising from the assumptions made in calculating dose intensity, cannot be excluded.  Metaanalysis showed a relative probability of achieving complete remission of 1.34 (95% confidence interval, 1.13 to 1.58) favoring the pooled arm of high dose intensity.  Cross-trial analysis showed a relatively weak association between dose intensity and remission rate (r = .49, P = .0001).  Two of four reports retrospectively assessing received dose intensity suggested that increased dose intensity is associated with superior remission rates.  These analyses suggest that dose intensity may correlate with the remission rate in advanced-stage intermediate-grade lymphoma.  However, properly designed trials directly testing dose intensity have not been performed and are needed to confirm this hypothesis."
Ohsumed,2311,test,"Value of peak exercise oxygen consumption for optimal timing of cardiac transplantation in ambulatory patients with heart failure.  BACKGROUND.  Optimal timing of cardiac transplantation in ambulatory patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction is often difficult.  To determine whether measurement of peak oxygen consumption (VO2) during maximal exercise testing can be used to identify patients in whom transplantation can be safely deferred, we prospectively performed exercise testing on all ambulatory patients referred for transplant between October 1986 and December 1989.  METHODS AND RESULTS.  Patients were assigned into one of three groups on the basis of exercise data: Group 1 (n = 35) comprised patients accepted for transplant (VO2 less than or equal to 14 ml/kg/min); group 2 (n = 52) comprised patients considered too well for transplant (VO2 greater than 14 ml/kg/min); and group 3 (n = 27) comprised patients with low VO2 rejected for transplant due to noncardiac problems.  All three groups were comparable in New York Heart Association functional class, ejection fraction, and cardiac index (p = NS).  Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was significantly lower in group 2 than in either group 1 or 3 (p less than 0.05), although there was wide overlap.  Patients with preserved exercise capacity (group 2) had cumulative 1- and 2-year survival rates of 94% and 84%, which are equal to survival levels after transplantation.  In contrast, patients rejected for transplant (group 3) had survival rates of only 47% at 1 year and 32% at 2 years, whereas patients awaiting transplantation (group 1) had a survival rate of 70% at 1 year (both p less than 0.005 versus patients with VO2 greater than 14 ml/kg/min).  All deaths in group 2 were sudden.  By univariate and multivariate analyses, peak VO2 was the best predictor of survival, with only pulmonary capillary wedge pressure providing additional prognostic information.  CONCLUSIONS.  These data suggest that cardiac transplantation can be safely deferred in ambulatory patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction and peak exercise VO2 of more than 14 ml/min/kg."
IMDb-top_1000,28,validation,"Pistol-packing Pam Grier takes names and kicks butt as the heroine in ""Asylum of Satan"" director William Girdler's entertaining blaxploitation actioneer ""Sheba Baby,"" co-starring D'Urville Martin and Austin Stoker. ""Sheba Baby"" is one of several tough chick flicks that Grier appeared in during the 1970s, including ""Coffy,"" ""Foxy Brown,"" and ""Friday Foster."" The short-lived Girdler co-wrote this thoroughly routine private eye potboiler with producer David Shelton in one night and it features a headstrong female shamus that refuses to rely on a man to help her take care of business. Unfortunately, ""Sheba Baby"" isn't nearly as good as the blaxploitation movies that Grier made under the supervision of director Jack Hill. Hill helmed the African-American North Carolina native in ""Coffy,"" ""Foxy Brown,"" ""The Big Bird Cage,"" and ""The Big Doll House."" Anybody that analyzes images of African-American women in cinema should be familiar with these epics. The chief problem with ""Sheba Baby"" is that our heroine gets too many convenient breaks. Naturally, the secondary villains are trigger happy clowns that couldn't hit the side of a barn with a howitzer. As the main antagonist, Dick Merrifield qualifies as both an egotistical as well as smarmy villain with choice lines like: ""Anything worth having is worth stealing."" Additionally, composer Monk Huggins does provide a strong, atmospheric orchestral soundtrack, and the best song, with Barbara Mason warbling it, is ""Good Man Is Gone."" ""Sheba Baby"" casts Grier as stylist Chicago gumshoe Sheba Shayne. She leaves the Windy City to return to her hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, to help out her father. When she arrives in Louisville, Sheba learns that her father, Andy (Rudy Challenger of ""Detroit 9000""), is having trouble with a local black gangster nicknamed Pilot (cigar-chomping D'Urville Martin of ""Hammer"") who demands that Andy sell out his loan company to Pilot or die.<br /><br />Initially, Pilot dispatches a goon squad to trash Andy's office, but our heroine's father catches them in the act. They turn Sheba's father into a punching bag. Interestingly, during the fight scene, Girdler rarely shows fists smashing flesh. Earlier, Andy's right-hand man, Brick Williams (Austin Stoker of ""Horror High""), had sent Sheba a telegram requesting that she return to Louisville, but she didn't receive it immediately thanks to her lazy partner who didn't know where to find her. Brick and Sheba hook up, rekindle their romantic flames, and share a night in the sack. Brick spends most of his time urging Sheba to remain calm in the face of adversity. As a former Louisville, Kentucky, police woman, Sheba prefers to shoot first and ask questions second. After she arrives home, Sheba borrows her father's car and barely escapes being blown to bits. As she is walking out the door to get into her father's car, Andy receives another harassing call from Pilot. Previously, Andy had refused to discuss the prospect of selling his loan company to Pilot, but Andy changes his mind and agrees to talk with the hoodlum. A gratified Pilot warns Andy about the dynamite that has been attached to his ignition with a delayed action fuse. In other words, cranking up the car won't trigger the explosion; the explosion comes ten seconds later. Andy and Brick rescue Sheba before the car blows up. Earlier, Sheba had agreed to let her father handle his problems without her interference. ""Dad, I know you think I'm doing a man's job, but I'm not going to sit on the sidelines just because I'm a woman,"" Sheba tells him. After her near-death experience, Sheba vows to learn who sabotaged her father's car. She grilles an old contact from her days as a cop and threatens the guy with her gun to extract the information. Only after Sheba has ground the guy's face into a bucket of chlorine dust does he relent and tell her about a pay-off at the town's railroad museum. Brick accompanies Sheba and shooting ensues with a flustered Pilot getting away by the skin of his chin.<br /><br />Later, Pilot sends a quintet of out-of-town contract thugs armed-to-the-teeth to trash Andy's office. These gunsels ignore their no-kill orders. Not only do they shoot the loan company office to ribbons, but they also blast Sheba's dad with a shotgun. Sheba retaliates in short order. Wielding her nickel-plated revolver, she guns down three of the four assailants Dirty Harry style. The last hit-man discards his weapon and pleads for mercy. Sheba has her finger on the trigger when Homicide Detective Phil Jackson (Charles Kissinger of ""Abby"") and a uniform cop arrive on the scene. At the hospital, Andy Shayne dies holding his daughter's hand. Naturally, Pilot is furious at this revelation and his fury borders on apoplexy. Afterward, Sheba tracks down a loan shark, Walker (Christopher Joy of ""Cleopatra Jones""), and pries information out of him about the Pilot while she holds him at gunpoint in a car wash. This is one of the better staged scenes with lots of ominous shots of the car wash equipment whirling and humming. Walker warns Pilot about Sheba. Pilot and his henchmen confront Sheba in a parking lot and swap lead. Sheba flees on foot to a nearby carnival. While the police corner one of Pilot's men, she deals with the others. Pilot shoots one of his own accidentally and Sheba runs him down. She pins Pilot to a roller-coaster track and threatens to hold him there until the roller-coaster cuts his head off. Pilot manages to escape after he has spilled his guts to Sheba about the identity and phone number of the big man, Shark (Dick Merrifield of ""The Hellcats""), whose reputation is so immaculate that Detective Jackson describes him as ""the guy with all the right answers."" ""Sheba Baby"" isn't top-notch Pam Grier. However, the idea that our heroine can handle everything by herself without help from guys makes it interesting as well as entertaining chick flick."

Ohsumed,66,validation,Denatured muscle grafts for nerve repair. An experimental model of nerve damage in leprosy   About 20% of patients with leprosy develop localised granulomatous lesions in peripheral nerves.  We report experiments in guinea-pigs in which freeze-thawed autogenous muscle grafts were used for the treatment of such mycobacterial granulomas.  Granulomas were induced in guinea-pig tibial nerves and the animals were left for 7 to 100 days in order to assess maximal damage.  The local area of nerve damage was then excised and the gap filled with denatured muscle grafts.  Clinical assessment after periods up to 150 days showed good sensory and motor recovery which correlated well with the histological findings.  The muscle graft technique may be of value for the treatment of chronic nerve lesions in selected cases of leprosy.

Ohsumed,1377,test,"Identification of viable myocardium in patients with chronic coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction. Comparison of thallium scintigraphy with reinjection and PET imaging with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose   In patients with chronic coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction, the distinction between ventricular dysfunction arising from myocardial fibrosis and ischemic, but viable, myocardium has important clinical implications.  By positron emission tomography (PET), enhanced fluorine-18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in myocardial segments with impaired function and reduced blood flow is evidence of myocardial viability.  Reinjection of thallium-201 at rest immediately after stress-redistribution imaging may also provide evidence of myocardial viability by demonstrating thallium uptake in regions with apparently ""irreversible"" defects.  To compare these two methods, we studied 16 patients with chronic coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction, 27 +/- 9%), all of whom had irreversible defects on standard exercise-redistribution thallium single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging.  Thallium was reinjected immediately after the redistribution study, and SPECT images were reacquired.  The patients also underwent PET imaging with FDG and oxygen-15-labeled water.  A total of 432 myocardial segments were analyzed from comparable transaxial tomograms, of which 166 (38%) had irreversible thallium defects on redistribution images before reinjection.  FDG uptake was demonstrated in 121 (73%) of these irreversible defects.  Irreversible defects were then subgrouped according to the degree of thallium activity, relative to peak activity in normal regions.  Irreversible defects with only mild (60-85% of peak activity) or moderate (50-59% of peak) reduction in thallium activity were considered viable on the basis of FDG uptake in 91% and 84% of these segments, respectively.  In contrast, in irreversible defects with severe reduction in thallium activity (less than 50% of peak), FDG uptake was present in 51% of segments.  In such severe defects, an identical number of segments (51%) demonstrated enhanced uptake of thallium after reinjection.  In these severe ""irreversible"" defects, data on myocardial viability were concordant by the two techniques in 88% of segments, with 45% identified as viable and 43% identified as scar on both PET and thallium reinjection studies.  These observations suggest that thallium imaging can be used to identify viable myocardium in patients with chronic coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction.  Most irreversible defects with only mild or moderate reduction in thallium activity represent viable myocardium as confirmed by FDG uptake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)."

Ohsumed,3466,test,"Transcriptional regulation of ferritin messenger ribonucleic acid levels by insulin in cultured rat glioma cells.  Recent data have shown that ferritin, a ubiquitous protein, has a role as a regulator of cellular differentiation.  In the present study we have investigated the expression of ferritin mRNAs in cultured C6 cells, a rat glioma cell line, in response to insulin, which has an important role in cellular growth and differentiation.  Insulin stimulated steady state levels of both ferritin heavy chain and ferritin light chain mRNAs.  An increase in the level of ferritin heavy or light chain mRNA was detected after 2 h of incubation with insulin, and a plateau was reached after 48 h for heavy chain mRNA and after 72 h for light chain mRNA.  The responses were dose-dependent and were maximal at 100 nM for both mRNAs.  Treatment of cells with actinomycin-D showed that insulin had no effect on the posttranscriptional stability of these mRNAs.  Actinomycin-D inhibited insulin-induced accumulation of both mRNAs, suggesting transcriptional stimulation of ferritin genes by insulin.  A nuclear run-on assay showed that the insulin-induced increase in ferritin heavy chain mRNA was due to an increase in the rate of gene transcription.  We also demonstrated that insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) increased ferritin heavy and light chain mRNA levels in a dose-dependent fashion, and that the maximum effect was obtained at a concentration of 10 nM on both mRNA levels.  IGF-I was not only 10-fold more potent, but the absolute level of maximum stimulation was also about 2-fold greater than that for insulin.  The combination of insulin (100 nM) and IGF-I (10 nM) showed no additive effect.  The results suggested that the ferritin heavy and light chain genes are transcriptionally regulated by insulin and influenced by IGF-I."

The glucose transporter of the human brain has been localized to endothelial cells expressing the blood-brain barrier, but little is known regarding its mechanism of induction or whether its expression is exclusively linked with restricted vascular permeability.  We investigated glucose transporter expression by vessels in human astrocytic tumors and pulmonary metastases to the brain using immunohistochemical techniques.  Vessels in 9 of 10 low-grade astrocytomas and 8 of 10 anaplastic astrocytomas were positive for glucose transporter.  Glioblastoma vessels were transporter-positive in only 2 of 10 specimens.  Vessels in all three metastatic tumors were negative for the glucose transporter.  The decrease in transporter expression observed in higher-grade tumors occurred independently of increases in vascular permeability.  In low-grade astrocytomas and glioblastomas transporter expression and contrast enhancement were inversely related, but vessels in 6 of 9 anaplastic astrocytomas were transporter-positive despite contrast enhancement.  These findings suggest that separate mechanisms induce the glucose transporter and the permeability restrictions of the human blood-brain barrier.  They also have potential implications for the therapy and prognosis of astroglial neoplasms."

IMDb-top_1000,281,test,"Commissaire Mattei(André Bourvil) is a single with a little gun who loves cats and his boss at the Paris police department is a philosopher who knows that even the police becomes sooner or later guilty. That is what the film is all about. And a jewel robbery at the place Vendome.<br /><br />Corey (Delon) brings the plan from prison, Vogel(Volonté)joins him and helps him against two tough guys, who are after him, because he took mafioso Ricos(Andre Eycan) money, while Rico already took Coreys girl friend and left him very much alone for five years in jail. Corey and Vogel find a third man, Jansen(Montand), a former police officer and sniper who opens a security lock by shooting special hand made ammunition into a hole. A perfect plan and cooperation, but they have to sell the booty and there is Mattei in the role of a buyer in disguise. The circle closes. Running to help each other they are shot by the cat loving Mattei and his little pistol.<br /><br />It took Melville 20 years he says to make a robbery film after he failed to get a contract for RIFFIFI. Melville wrote the screenplay and filmed in the south of France and in Paris of yesteryear. The great Henri Decae is as usual the lighting cameraman. It is the one before last picture of Melvilles who died after another film with Delon in 1972.<br /><br />Melville actually wanted Belmondo instead of Volonté, he didn't like that Italian at all, but Volonté-Vogel is an excellent fugitive and gives next to Bourvil the most convincing performance. But mind you: Melville notes, that Volonté is an instinctive actor, a strange character, very wearying and absolutely impossible on a French set. Melville didn't like him at all and didn't want to work with him ever again.<br /><br />Melville is wrong. Volonté give the most lively character in the nowhere of not so many interesting characters. You can see what he is feeling being chased by Mattei and his little dangerous gun and all the dogs of France in winter 70. A wild actor.<br /><br />Also André Bourvil, who passed away close to the time of the filming. He also was not first choice, but definitely a great substitute. He carries the instinct of a lonely hunter through the whole film and gets in the end his chance to become guilty once more.<br /><br />Jansen has entered at night the jewelry shop with a rifle and a tripod but risks eventually freehandedly a successful shot. When he meets Delon the first time we already know that the elegant Jansen has a severe drinking problem. After the robbery Montand renounces to take his part of the booty and mentions to Delon, who looks up to him, that he only got into the red circle, because he wanted to take revenge on the inhabitants of his wardrobe. Delon doesn't catch what he means. The audience recalls having seen Montand in a great scene in his haunted house fighting helplessly nightmare creatures that come out of the wardrobe and attack him. At that time a very rare scene, one recalls a long time after. I bet it was ever so difficult to arrange and direct that stuff at a time no one imagined the coming days of digital movie making. Great artwork when art was made by hand.<br /><br />We sure will remember a crew like the actors, still it seems even after 33 years this one stays the less popular of the six thrillers of Melville. What is wrong with it? I am afraid one doesn't take much interest in those three actors (showing three criminals) and their police hunter. We learn too little about Corey and his fatal 5 years away from his beautiful girl(Anna Douking). Montand is still a great sniper, but what made him become a drinking man with funny creatures in his wardrobe. Delon acts as if he is in an earlier adventure of the samourai, Volonté is the man in the trunk of Delons American car and superbly moving and Mattei is swell to look at, a great actor at the edge of his life. But how could he ever possibly doubt that all are guilty ?<br /><br />In an interview Melville states, that there is no woman in the film. Not in the very red circle, but I remember well that jolly good looking female Anna Douking (with no future career). We are in the 70s. There in fact rises a woman from the bed of an old mafioso wearing nothing and walks slowly to the door to listen to the voice of her old lover Delon. Bardot did something like that 10 years earlier. This time Melville was directing. Well done.<br /><br />The RED CERCLE has certainly added a few but not many glittering gems to film history. The robbery at Place Vendome and Montands wonder bullet the inhabitants of the wardrobe and Volonté escaping Bouvil in white underwear and carrying his trousers carefully across a stream. That is too little for a great gangster and robbery movie. But the 110 minutes never bore you and it is a game on a high level. And there are probably some secrets you learn when you see the film over and over again. None of the secrets is that we are all guilty and the late Francois Perier is also featured.<br /><br />Michael Zabel"

Ohsumed,889,test,"Antibiotic-associated hypoprothrombinemia: a review of prospective studies, 1966-1988.  Many antimicrobial agents have been associated with hypoprothrombinemia.  The precise mechanisms are unknown, but alteration in vitamin K status or utilization is involved.  The two postulated mechanisms implicate either direct inhibition of biosynthesis of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors by the N-methylthiotetrazole (NMTT) moiety found in certain antimicrobial agents or eradication of vitamin K-producing intestinal microflora in patients with reduced oral intake of vitamin K.  An English-language review of all prospective studies reported between 1966 and 1988 in which serial prothrombin times were monitored in adult patients revealed that the incidence of hypoprothrombinemia varied from 3.7% to 64% with NMTT-containing regimens and from 0% to 24% with non-NMTT-containing regimens.  Detailed evaluation of these and other studies suggests that certain risk factors, including malnutrition, hepatic and renal dysfunction, older age, and severity of illness, may be the major determinants of hypoprothrombinemia.  The hypothesis that the NMTT side chain is primarily responsible for hypoprothrombinemia may not be justified.  We conclude that patients at high risk for coagulopathy should be carefully monitored and that serious consideration should be given to the use of prophylactic vitamin K in such cases."
Ohsumed,3767,test,"Childhood traumas: an outline and overview   Childhood psychic trauma appears to be a crucial etiological factor in the development of a number of serious disorders both in childhood and in adulthood.  Like childhood rheumatic fever, psychic trauma sets a number of different problems into motion, any of which may lead to a definable mental condition.  The author suggests four characteristics related to childhood trauma that appear to last for long periods of life, no matter what diagnosis the patient eventually receives.  These are visualized or otherwise repeatedly perceived memories of the traumatic event, repetitive behaviors, trauma-specific fears, and changed attitudes about people, life, and the future.  She divides childhood trauma into two basic types and defines the findings that can be used to characterize each of these types.  Type I trauma includes full, detailed memories, ""omens,"" and misperceptions.  Type II trauma includes denial and numbing, self-hypnosis and dissociation, and rage.  Crossover conditions often occur after sudden, shocking deaths or accidents that leave children handicapped.  In these instances, characteristics of both type I and type II childhood traumas exist side by side.  There may be considerable sadness.  Each finding of childhood trauma discussed by the author is illustrated with one or two case examples."

Ohsumed,144,test,"Detection, prevalence, and prognosis of asymptomatic carcinoma of the cervix.  Between 1979-1986, 82 of 407 patients (20%) treated for infiltrative carcinoma of the cervix were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis.  Sixteen (20%) of these 82 patients had stage IA, 60 (73%) had stage IB, and six (7%) had stage IIA disease.  Asymptomatic patients represented 16 of 23 (70%) of stage IA, 60 of 196 (31%) of stage IB, and six of 77 (8%) of stage IIA.  In the Netherlands, population screening for cervical carcinoma is conducted on women aged 35-55 years.  To examine the prevalence of asymptomatic cervical carcinoma and the way in which it was detected in different age groups, we studied the patients referred to our department.  Among the patients younger than 35 years with cervical carcinoma, 20 of 70 (29%) were asymptomatic with disease detected by incidental screening, whereas eight of 177 (5%) in the group 55 years or older had been detected by incidental screening.  In the age category 35-55 years, 54 of 160 (34%) were asymptomatic.  Patients aged 35-55 years had undergone population screening or incidental screening.  In the patients 55 years or older, asymptomatic disease was significantly less prevalent than in younger patients.  Only one of the 66 asymptomatic patients in stage IB or higher suffered tumor recurrence.  Among symptomatic patients, 25 of 136 (18%) with stage IB and 17 of 71 (24%) with stage IIA had tumor recurrence.  Despite the favorable prognosis of patients with asymptomatic carcinoma, asymptomatic presentation could not be shown to be a significant prognostic factor, as were tumor diameter and lymph node status."
Ohsumed,191,validation,"Segregation analysis of breast cancer from the cancer and steroid hormone study: histologic subtypes   The segregation pattern of breast cancer in white families from the Cancer and Steroid Hormone Study was investigated.  Families were categorized into four groups based on the histologic type of breast cancer in the probands:ductal cancer, lobular cancer, adenocarcinoma, and medullary cancer.  The ductal cancer sample was further split into a premenopausal-proband and a postmenopausal-proband subset.  Results for six complex segregation analyses are presented; the findings suggest heterogeneity in the transmission of breast cancer.  For all analyses, there was no evidence for a multifactorial component in the mixed model, ie, a major locus plus other transmission, genetic and/or cultural.  Interpretation of the medullary cancer, adenocarcinoma, and lobular cancer analyses does not permit discrimination among the major locus models.  Segregation of breast cancer in the entire ductal sample was consistent with autosomal recessive transmission.  In the ductal subanalyses, a recessive gene was sufficient to explain the breast cancer distribution when the proband had postmenopausal breast cancer.  In contrast, when the proband had premenopausal breast cancer, the transmission model was consistent with a dominant major gene, with sporadic cases of disease."

Ohsumed,103,test,"A report of fluorosis in the United States secondary to drinking well water.  A 54-year-old female resident of Wellston, Okla, was found to have osteosclerosis on a routine chest roentgenogram.  Subsequent investigation disclosed the cause of her osteosclerosis to be fluorosis secondary to the ingestion of well water containing 429 mumol/L of fluoride (recommended levels, 11 to 58 mumol/L).  Water samples were also obtained from the 12 wells on properties adjacent to the index case.  In three other wells, all at similar depths as the well of the index case, the fluoride concentration of the water was greater than 212 mumol/L.  Urine samples from members of the four households who obtain their drinking water from these wells contained elevated urinary fluoride levels.  Thus, fluorosis may develop in certain areas of the United States as a result of the natural occurrence of fluoride in the groundwater.  Consequently, in known endemic areas, it would appear reasonable to measure the fluoride concentration of the well water at the time of drilling."
Ohsumed,3708,test,"Distribution of endogenous albumin in the glomerular wall of proteinuric patients.  Glomerular proteinuria seems to be related, in part, to loss or impairment of the normal barrier function of the glomerular capillary wall.  To investigate the functional properties of this barrier, endogenous albumin was revealed in the glomerular wall of proteinuric patients and compared with a nonproteinuric control by immunoelectron microscopy using the protein A-gold method.  In the control biopsy, peaks of albumin accumulation were noted in the subendothelial area and in the inner portion of the lamina densa, with gradual tapering of the distribution toward the epithelial side of the basement membrane.  The urinary space and epithelial cells were weakly labeled.  In tissues from proteinuric patients, albumin was distributed throughout the entire width of the glomerular basement membrane, although the pattern of accumulation varied between patients.  The urinary space showed significant labeling associated with some flocculent material.  Mesangial areas were heavily labeled in tissues from both control and proteinuric patients.  In the latter, lysozomes in glomerular and tubular epithelial cells also accumulated albumin, which is evidence of reabsorption.  These results reveal the existence, in normal conditions, of a barrier located in the subendothelial area of the glomerular basement membrane, the loss of which, as in the idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, leads to diffuse distribution of albumin in the glomerular capillary wall."
Ohsumed,1535,test,"Estimated burden of diabetes mellitus in Manitoba according to health insurance claims: a pilot study.  OBJECTIVE: To estimate the burden of diabetes mellitus in Manitoba from 1980 to 1984.  DESIGN: Review of the Manitoba Health Services Commission (MHSC) database.  The validity of the MHSC data was established through two substudies: one involved self-reports from a survey of elderly Manitobans, and the other involved people with confirmed diabetes enrolled in the provincial diabetes education program.  SUBJECTS: Sample of 100,000 people stratified by age, sex and MHSC health region: 50,000 were aged 25 to 64 years, and 50,000 were aged 65 or more.  All MHSC claims containing the ICD-9-CM code for diabetes mellitus or gestational diabetes were identified.  MAIN RESULTS: Of the sample 7627 people were found to have a diagnosis of diabetes, the annual prevalence being 0.8% among those 25 to 44 years of age, 3.5% among those 45 to 64 and 7.6% among those 65 or older.  The annual incidence rate among those over 25 years of age was 7.8 per 1000.  Of the 4556 pregnant women 25 to 44 years old 85 (1.9%) had diabetes; 23 were believed to have gestational diabetes.  CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and prevalence rates were similar to those determined on the basis of self-reports in Canadian and US national surveys.  The use of an administrative database such as that of the MHSC will provide key information for planning health services for diabetic patients and will permit the monitoring of long-term trends in the incidence and prevalence of the disease."

Ohsumed,1558,test,"Enhanced in vitro uptake and retention of 3H-tetraphenylphosphonium by nervous system tumor cells.  Photodynamic therapy is a promising treatment for human brain tumors because of the selective retention of certain compounds by tumor cells.  Certain lipophilic cationic compounds, such as tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP), are selectively taken up by a variety of carcinomas.  Although preferential retention of TPP has been demonstrated for the breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7, this compound had not been tested previously on cells derived from nervous system tumors.  In the present study, tritiated-TPP (3H-TPP) uptake and retention for eight different cell cultures of three histologically different types of nervous system tumors was measured and the data were compared to a positive control (MCF-7) and negative controls (normal African Green monkey kidney epithelium (CV-1) and the normal human fibroblast (WI-38) cell lines).  Uptake and retention characteristics could be grouped by specific pathological tumor types, but individual tumor variability was notable.  Malignant astrocytoma (grade III/III glioblastoma) and malignant neurofibrosarcoma cells showed preferential uptake and retention of 3H-TPP relative to meningioma cells and normal controls.  A clonogenic assay utilizing the cytotoxic lipophilic cationic compound dequalinium showed strong retainers of 3H-TPP to be more susceptible to the effects of dequalinium than weak retainers.  These data demonstrate that certain human and experimental animal nervous system tumor cell lines retain lipophilic compounds possessing a delocalized positive charge.  Lipophilic cationic compounds may be useful in the intraoperative delineation of tumor margins and in the photodynamic therapy of certain nervous system tumors."

Normal, scarred, and dystrophic corneas were histochemically probed with a panel of 16 lectins by means of an avidin-biotin revealing system.  Normal corneal epithelial cells, keratocytes, and endothelial cells expressed at least two distinct N-linked oligosaccharide subsets, of the non-bisected, biantennary and bisected, bi-/triantennary types.  Corneal scars stained variably with the lectin subsets described above, and with Maclura pomifera agglutinin.  Lattice dystrophy corneas showed a loss of the oligosaccharide expression observed on the plasma membranes of normal epithelial cells, and there was concurrent deposition of extracellular glycoprotein within the corneal stroma, which was of the same oligosaccharide subsets as were lost from the epithelial cell plasma membranes.  This extracellular stromal glycoprotein was far more widely deposited than the amyloid and extended well beyond the stromal scarring.  We propose that these observations are related and that in lattice corneal dystrophy a glycoprotein(s) is shed from the plasma membranes of epithelial cells and sequestrated within the corneal stroma, where it subsequently stimulates amyloid deposition."

This is the first report on the photodynamic treatment with a second-generation sensitizer, chloro-aluminum sulfonated phthalocyanine (CASPc) of spontaneously arising tumors and on the photodynamic therapy (PDT) of snake neoplasms.  Each of 10 cats, 2 dogs, and 3 snakes presenting with a variety of tumor types (squamous cell carcinoma, mast cell malignant tumor, and mixed carcinoma/sarcoma) was given an intravenous injection of 1 mg of CASPc per kilogram body weight 48 hours prior to irradiation with 675-nm light.  Some larger tumors (greater than 1.5 cm deep) were surgically debulked prior to PDT.  No significant systemic toxicity or skin photosensitization was observed in any animal.  The tumor responses were comparable to those seen with conventional cryotherapy, hyperthermia, or surgery.  PDT with CASPc of these cases led to 67% (12 of 18) complete response, 22% (4 of 18) partial response, and 11% (2 of 18) no response (less than 50% reduction in tumor size).  Four cases could not be evaluated.  Since the overall tumor response to CASPc is very good, and the problem of skin photosensitivity is nonexistent, it is expected that using CASPc-PDT to eradicate human tumors would also yield comparable results.  Further studies with long-term follow-up are necessary to optimize the use of CASPc-PDT in veterinary and human medicine."

Transgenic mice in which c-myc expression is targeted to pancreatic acinar cells develop mixed acinar/ductal pancreatic adenocarcinomas between 2 and 7 months of age.  This contrasts with the effect on pancreas of the simian virus 40 tumor antigen or activated ras, which in adult mice causes lesions composed exclusively of acinar-like cells.  Furthermore, during an early stage of myc-induced pathology, transformed acinar-derived cells appear within islets, suggesting that islet hormones may influence the progression of these exocrine pancreatic tumors.  These findings demonstrate that the initial oncogenic alteration can influence the pattern of subsequent tumor pathogenesis and, given that human exocrine pancreatic tumors are predominantly ductal adenocarcinomas, support the suggestion that transformed acinar cells may contribute to the genesis of this serious disease in man."

The aim of this clinical, endoscopical study was to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and the gastric tolerability of etodolac, a new anti-inflammatory, non-steroidal drug, compared with naproxen.  The study was conducted on 48 patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis.  44 of whom completed the trial.  After an initial oesophagogastroduodenoscopy to exclude the presence of gastric mucosal lesions, patients were randomly allocated to double-blind treatment with either etodolac 200 mg b.i.d.  or naproxen 500 mg b.i.d.  for a period of 4 weeks.  Endoscopic control followed this treatment period.  Both drugs proved effective in relieving clinical symptoms, without a statistically significant difference.  Gastric mucosal lesions were observed in 15% of etodolac-treated patients and in 46% of patients treated with naproxen (P less than 0.05) (95% CI 0.01-0.60).  Painful dyspepsia was observed in 15% of patients treated with etodolac vs.  38% of patients on naproxen therapy.  This study demonstrates that etodolac is at least as active as naproxen in relieving rheumatic symptoms, and its administration results in a significantly lower degree of gastric damage."

In the remaining 35 patients, we identified 39 potential mechanisms: large-artery atherosclerosis (19 patients, 40%), cardioembolism (15 patients, 32%), and small-vessel occlusive disease (5 patients, 11%).  Of 11 patients with carotid atherosclerosis and stroke, 9 (82%) had greater than 90% carotid stenosis or occlusion; of 12 patients with stroke of undetermined mechanism, 10 (83%) had previous stroke, of which 8 were also of undetermined mechanisms.  Disability after stroke was moderate or severe in 27 patients (57%).  These data suggest that (1) stroke in patients taking aspirin has a variety of etiologies and frequently causes moderate or severe disability; (2) patients with carotid disease failing aspirin often have high-grade carotid stenosis or occlusion; (3) stroke of undetermined mechanism may recur more frequently than other stroke subtypes in patients taking aspirin."

In one, scars were mainly left perisylvian and involved portions of the vascular border zone of the temporal cortex.  In the other, scars were more numerous and occurred in the border zone of the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries symmetrically.  All three cases showed to a variable extent brain warts, molecular layer ectopias, and focal architectonic dysplasia identical to those seen in the male cases.  Two women had primary brain neoplasms, an oligodendroglioma and a low-grade astrocytoma, respectively, and two women showed small angiomas.  Reexamination of previously reported male cases disclosed one with myelinated glial scars.  Two control brains with asymmetrical plana temporale showed myelinated glial scars as well.  The significance of the anatomical findings is discussed, and possible etiological factors are considered with known effects of autoimmune diseases on the nervous system."

Ohsumed,1483,test,"Surgical procedures in the management of Takayasu's arteritis.  Takayasu's arteritis is an inflammatory arteriopathy that often progresses to obliteration of multiple large arteries.  Variable results have been reported after medical and surgical management.  Twenty female patients with Takayasu's arteritis were treated from 1973 to 1989.  Eleven (55%) patients had hypertension.  Upper or lower extremity ischemia was present in 12 (60%) patients and cerebrovascular insufficiency in seven (35%).  Nine patients initially managed with corticosteroids had no improvement in signs or symptoms of arterial insufficiency.  Eleven patients had 16 vascular procedures for the following indications: renovascular hypertension (6), extremity ischemia (5), cerebrovascular insufficiency (2), dilation ascending aorta with aortic insufficiency (1), thoracic aortic aneurysm (1), abdominal aortic aneurysm (1).  Procedures included aortorenal bypass (5), carotid-subclavian, axillary, or brachial bypass (4), aorto-carotid bypass (2), aneurysm resection (2), supra-celiac aorto-femoral bypass (1), ascending aorta/aortic valve replacement (1), and nephrectomy (1).  Clinical improvement occurred in all patients.  There were no operative deaths.  All are alive at a mean follow-up of 5.75 years (6 months to 16 years).  Revision of the initial reconstruction has been required for recurrent renovascular hypertension in one patient and extremity ischemia in another.  The other nine patients remain symptomatically improved.  Symptomatic Takayasu's arteritis frequently requires arterial reconstruction.  Symptomatic improvement and excellent long-term graft patency can be expected after arterial reconstruction."

Chondrons were isolated from human and canine osteoarthritic cartilage using low-speed homogenization techniques.  Changes in chondron morphology were evaluated using differential interference-contrast microscopy, phase-contrast microscopy, and histochemical and ultrastructural methods.  Chondrocyte viability was assessed using fluorescein diacetate staining, and chondron metabolism was investigated using autoradiography.  The results suggest that initial changes in the collagen and proteoglycan distribution within the chondron are followed by chondrocyte proliferation to form clusters.  These techniques offer the potential to study cell matrix interactions in degenerative osteoarthritis."

Because there are both treatable and untreatable causes of dementia, the physician's ability to conduct (or refer a patient for) a differential diagnosis could have a profound effect on health outcomes for patients and on health care costs.  This study was undertaken to assess physician practices with regard to the diagnosis of dementing disorders.  Data from 53 physicians (a response rate of 48%) in several specialties were obtained from a self-administered mail questionnaire.  Results indicate that the majority of physicians provided history taking, physical examination, and neurological examination.  Physicians were more likely to refer patients for psychiatric and neuropsychological examinations than to provide these services themselves.  The results also point to deficiencies in two key areas: the use of formal, published diagnostic criteria, and the use of mental status and cognitive function tests.  Over 75% of physicians surveyed did not use either DSM-III or NINCDS-ADRDA diagnostic criteria, and 42% of physicians did not provide any mental status tests themselves.

Patients failing TAM could subsequently receive FLU.  The dose of both drugs was 10 mg orally twice daily.  Objective responses were seen in 50 of 119 (42%) TAM patients and 64 of 119 (54%) TAM plus FLU patients (two-sided P = 0.07).  Time to disease progression was better for TAM plus FLU (medians: 11.6 versus 6.5 months; Cox model, P = 0.03).  Duration of response and survival were similar in the two treatment arms.  Among 97 patients with estrogen receptor (ER) of 10 or greater and 65 years of age or older, there were highly significant advantages for treatment with TAM plus FLU in both response rate and time to progression.  Of particular note is that in this patient group TAM plus FLU showed a survival advantage (Cox model, P = 0.05).  Although these data require confirmation in a prospective randomized trial, they suggest that there is a substantive therapeutic advantage for TAM plus FLU over TAM alone in elderly women with ER of 10 fmol or greater."

In idiopathic nephrotic syndrome, and in experimental models of nephrosis, changes of visceral epithelial cells involve the entire glomerular population while segmental sclerotic changes are reported to affect only a certain number of glomeruli.  Because conventional determination of the percentage of glomeruli affected by sclerotic lesions is usually based on the examination of randomly selected sections, we wondered whether glomeruli appearing normal in a given section could be affected by sclerosis in other regions of the capillary tuft (CT).  To assess the real incidence and the spatial extension of sclerotic changes at the level of single glomerulus, we used serial-section morphological analysis to measure the volume of the glomerulus and that of sclerosis lesions.  In glomeruli from control rats and in glomeruli from adriamycin (ADR) treated rats surface area of Bowman's capsule (BC), CT and sclerotic regions were measured using stereology techniques in all the consecutive sections containing each individual glomerulus, and corresponding volumes were then calculated.  Mean volume of BC and CT were not significantly different between control and ADR rats (0.71 +/- 0.03 and 0.53 +/- 0.03 vs.  0.76 +/- 0.04 and 0.53 +/- 0.02 microns 3 x 10(-6), respectively).

We evaluated levels of creatinine, creatinine clearance, beta 2-microglobulin, and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) as indicators of nephrotoxicity, and attempted to correlate them.  Forty patients met the criteria for evaluation; 14 were given tobramycin and the remaining 26 received gentamicin.  Significant nephrotoxicity, as defined by an increase in creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL, did not occur in either group.  Increases in beta 2-microglobulin values were seen in 67% of the patients in the tobramycin group, and 52% of those in the gentamicin group.  Elevations in NAG levels occurred in 54% of those in the tobramycin group and 52% of those in the gentamicin group.  Elevation of NAG and beta 2-microglobulin levels was congruent in only 40% of the cases.  We conclude that there was no significant difference in nephrotoxicity between gentamicin and tobramycin.  Elevations of NAG and beta 2-microglobulin occurred at rates similar to those reported in the literature, but they did not correlate with significant nephrotoxicity."

OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency and clinical characteristics of narrow QRS ventricular tachycardia (QRS duration less than or equal to 0.11 seconds).  DESIGN: Consecutive survey of patients with ventricular tachycardia.  SETTING: Tertiary, referral-based arrhythmia service at a university medical center.  PATIENTS: Sequential sample of patients with inducible ventricular tachycardia who had a 12-lead electrocardiogram of the tachycardia available for review.  MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 106 patients with ventricular tachycardia, 5 (4.7%; 95% CI, 2.1% to 10.6%) had ventricular tachycardia with a QRS duration less than or equal to 0.11 seconds.  Three of the five patients were previously incorrectly diagnosed as having supraventricular tachycardia.  All five patients had at least two electrocardiographic findings other than QRS duration to suggest ventricular tachycardia.  CONCLUSIONS: Narrow QRS ventricular tachycardia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of narrow QRS tachycardias.  Electrocardiographic findings other than QRS duration are usually present to suggest the diagnosis."
Ohsumed,99,test,"Mutations within the rhodopsin gene in patients with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa.  BACKGROUND.  Night blindness is an early symptom of retinitis pigmentosa.  The rod photoreceptors are responsible for night vision and use rhodopsin as the photosensitive pigment.  METHODS AND RESULTS.  We found three mutations in the human rhodopsin gene; each occurred exclusively in the affected members of some families with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa.  Two mutations were C-to-T transitions involving separate nucleotides of codon 347; the third was a C-to-G transversion in codon 58.  Each mutation corresponded to a change in one amino acid residue in the rhodopsin molecule.  None of these mutations were found in 106 unrelated normal subjects who served as controls.  When the incidence of these three mutations was added to that of a previously reported mutation involving codon 23, 27 of 150 unrelated patients with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (18 percent) were found to carry one of these four defects in the rhodopsin gene.  All 27 patients had abnormal rod function on monitoring of their electroretinograms.  It appears that patients with the mutation involving codon 23 probably descend from a single ancestor.  CONCLUSIONS.  In some patients with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, the disease is caused by one of a variety of mutations of the rhodopsin gene."

Several plastic materials used in blood storage were evaluated for their ability to transmit ultraviolet B (UVB) light.  A plastic bag manufactured from sheets of transparent Teflon efficiently (78-86%) transmitted UVB light and was employed in subsequent functional studies of lymphocytes and platelets exposed to UVB light while contained in these bags.  In vitro experiments showed a UVB dose-dependent abrogation of lymphocyte responder and stimulator functions, with concurrent preservation of platelet aggregation responses.  In a phase I pilot study, UVB-treated platelet concentrates were administered to four bone marrow transplant recipients.  Adverse effects attributable to the transfusions were not observed, and patients showed clinically effective transfusion responses.  No patient developed lymphocytotoxic HLA or platelet antibodies.  These studies suggest that platelets can be effectively irradiated with UVB light in a closed system.  However, numerous variables, including container material, volume and composition of contents, steady exposure versus agitation, and exact UV wavelength, must be considered."

Technetium-99m- and indium-111-IgG were co-administered to normal rats and biodistribution was determined at 2, 6, and 16 hr.  The inflammation imaging properties of the two reagents were compared in rats with deep-thigh infection due to Escherichia coli.  Blood clearance of both antibody preparations was well described by a bi-exponential function: (99mTc-IgG: t1/2 = 3.82 +/- 0.89 and 57.52 +/- 1.70 hr.  111In-IgG: 3.93 +/- 0.117 and 40.71 +/- 1.26 hr).  Biodistributions in the solid organs were similar, however, small but statistically significant differences were detected: 99mTc-IgG greater than 111In-IgG in lung, liver, and spleen; 99mTc-IgG less than 111In-IgG in kidney and skeletal muscle (p less than 0.01).  At all three imaging times, target-to-background ratio and percent residual activity for the two compounds were remarkably similar.  These studies establish that human polyclonal IgG labeled with 99mTc via a nicotinyl hydrazine modified intermediate is equivalent to 111In-IgG for imaging focal sites of infection in experimental animals."

This single moderate dose of APD reduced biochemical parameters of bone resorption during the time of follow-up.  After 2 months, urinary hydroxyproline excretion was still below the basal level.  The decreased serum calcium levels did not return to basal values.  Biochemical parameters of bone formation, serum alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, showed a slight increase during the first month after stimulation of the parathyroids and a corresponding increase in serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.  These formation parameters decreased thereafter, probably representing coupling between bone resorption and bone formation."

To study the effect of oncotic pressure on brain water content during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), 14 anesthetized New Zealand White rabbits underwent 60 min of nonpulsatile CPB at normothermia.  Animals were grouped according to the composition of the circuit priming fluid.  Group 1 animals (n = 7) received a priming fluid (6.5% hydroxyethyl starch in 0.72 N NaCl; 323 +/- 13 mOsm/kg [mean +/- SD]) that maintained normal colloid oncotic pressure (COP) during CPB (19.0 +/- 1.5 mmHg).  Group 2 animals (n = 7) received a priming fluid (0.9 N NaCl; 324 +/- 23 mOsm/kg) that led to a hypooncotic state (COP = 6.2 +/- 1.2 mmHg).  Blood chemistries and hemodynamics were recorded every 15 min during CPB.  Animals were given additional priming fluid and sodium bicarbonate during CPB to maintain a circuit flow of 85 ml.kg-1.min-1 and arterial pH greater than 7.35.  There were no significant differences between groups 1 and 2 with respect to temperature, central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure, PaO2, PaCO2, plasma sodium concentration, or osmolality at any time during CPB, although osmolality increased in both groups.  After 60 min of bypass, animals were killed and organ water contents were determined by wet/dry weight ratios.  A separate group of nine similarly prepared and anesthetized animals that did not undergo cannulation or CPB also underwent measurement of plasma chemistries and tissue water contents and served as nonbypass controls (group 3).

However, fibrinopeptide A levels remained unchanged after the attacks in the stable exertional angina group and after intracoronary injection of acetylcholine in the control group.  Plasma beta-thromboglobulin levels remained unchanged after the attacks in both patient groups and after acetylcholine in the control group.  Our data indicate that coronary spasm induces thrombin generation and may lead to thrombus formation in the coronary artery involved, but pacing-induced ischemia does not activate the coagulation system."

To examine the presence and time course of beta-adrenergic antagonism produced by amiodarone, the heart rate, QT interval and arrhythmia frequency in response to graded doses of isoproterenol were evaluated in eight patients treated with oral amiodarone for sustained ventricular tachycardia.  Measurements were made before and every 2 days after beginning oral amiodarone therapy (600 mg twice daily).  Isoproterenol was given in doses of 12.5, 25 and 50 ng/kg body weight per min.  The mean heart rate at rest decreased from 73.1 +/- 17.8 beats/min on day 0 to 57.8 +/- 15.0 beats/min after 12 days of amiodarone therapy.  A significant linear decline in heart rate at rest was observed until day 6 (p less than 0.05 for all comparisons).  On all days isoproterenol produced a progressive increase in heart rate that reached 115.5 +/- 20.2 beats/min on day 0 and 94.2 +/- 18.5 beats/min on day 12.  Amiodarone blunted the heart rate increase produced by isoproterenol on days 2 to 12 (p less than 0.05 versus day 0).  This effect was present by day 2 and did not change significantly thereafter.
