german banking authorities weigh swap regulations german banking authorities are weighing rules for banks off balance sheet activities in an attempt to cope with the growing volume of sophisticated capital market instruments banking sources said interest rate and currency swaps and currency options are under closest scrutiny and if revisions are made they may resemble regulation jointly proposed by the u s and u k to japan juergen becker director of the bundesbank s division of banking law and credit supervision said the u s british proposals were interesting but declined to elaborate but banking sources said west germany was more likely to produce its own conclusions than to adopt foreign proposals there is no formal plan yet but talks are in the latter stages one representative of the german banking association in cologne said bankers expect rule changes this year all alterations must be approved by the bundesbank west germany s four major banking associations and the federal banking supervisory office talks have been slowed by the fact that fundamental changes would require a revision of germany s credit law which has been in effect since authorities favour reinterpreting the credit law to fit present circumstances in order to avoid the long parliamentary political process of changing it banking sources said since the beginning of the banking law has limited banks lending to times shareholders equity plus reserves on a consolidated basis but lending ratios do not extend to several newer instruments such as spot and forward currency contracts currency and interest swaps commercial paper programs currency options interest rate futures in foreign currencies and various innovative types of interest rate hedges the sources said the main value of the u s u k proposals lay in differentiating between different types of risk factor and for instance in placing greater weight on currency swaps than interest swaps but even if german banking authorities agree with some of the assessments of swaps they disagree on how to find balance sheet equivalents for the risk u s british proposals include a complicated series of formulae for assessing the stream of payments involved in swaps whose ultimate risk is borne by the financial intermediary especially when counterparties remain anonymous this is the so called market to market value but german authorities are likely to consider this much too complex and to base their evaluation instead on a schedule of lending ratings assigned according to the creditworthiness of the borrowers involved the sources said the weightings also likely if lending ratios are extended to include banks securities portfolios are zero for public authorities pct for domestic banks pct for foreign banks and pct for other foreign and non bank borrowers a further complication is that the more flexible definitions of equity allowed in the u s and the u k may put german banks at a competitive disadvantage the sources said stricter definitions here also mean the use of a version of the u s u k proposals could far exceed the intent of the u s and british authorities the sources said one specialist for dresdner bank ag said a long dated foreign exchange forward transaction could for instance be brought under the same rule as a cross currency swap despite the fact that the risk may be entirely different how new regulations will affect foreign banks here was uncertain many have converted to full subsidiary status and applied for a full banking licence over the last two years in order to lead manage mark eurobonds but as their equity capital is fairly small tight lending ratios will severely hamper foreign banks freedom of movement particularly in the growing business of currency swaps if they are required to include more transactions in the balance sheet the sources added reuter,5

japan says oecd study on subsidies still ongoing japanese agriculture ministry officials said a study of agriculture subsidies by the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd is still under way and will be completed sometime next month the officials said the study has been inaccurate so far and they said japan would comment on the final results a reuter report from washington yesterday said the study has found that japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from subsidies the study has not been officially released due to objections from some countries japan has withdrawn its objection and decided to accept the release of the study the agriculture ministry officials said oecd directors are expected to approve the release at a meeting in mid may one agriculture ministry source said the study so far was based on the years japanese subsidies have dropped sharply since then partly because of tight budgetary policy and foreign currency factors have also changed he said the study is unfair and unacceptable because it does not take account of various differences in farming conditions in each country such as geography the source said he said it is highly likely that the final study will show japan has the highest farm subsidies in the world this would increase foreign pressure to open japan s farm market further but this would have little impact on japan s agriculture policy he said without giving further details a main purpose of the study is to clarify export subsidies by major exporting nations like the united states and the european community but japan is a major importer he said reuter,7
dome pete dmp takes billion dlr writedown dome petroleum ltd earlier reporting a billion dlr loss compared to year earlier profit of mln dlrs said the loss was mainly due to write downs totalling billion dlrs before a reduction in deferred income taxes of mln dlrs the loss also includes mln dlrs in accumulated foreign exchange losses the company said the dramatic drop in energy prices in early reverses much of the progress the company has made in the two previous years dome chairman j howard macdonald said in a statement but even a net loss of this magnitude has very little bearing on the day to day operations of dome chairman macdonald said it merely reflects the realistic carrying value of the company s assets in today s economic environment and the absolute need for reaching a timely agreement with our lenders on a debt restructuring plan to assure the company s continued existence he added dome is now trying to reach agreement on a complex plan for restructuring debt of more than billion dlrs dome said it charged the mln dlrs in accumulated foreign exchange losses to current expenses because of the uncertainty arising from its proposed restructuring plan normally the expenses would be amortized over the remaining period of the loans to which they apply it said dome also said the write downs included a fourth quarter reduction in the value of its oil and gas properties of billion dlrs before a reduction in deferred income taxes of mln dlrs the fourth quarter writedown was in addition to a charge of mln dlrs on certain other assets taken mainly in the third quarter dome said the billion dlr fourth quarter charge resulted from a year end accounting change made under new full cost accounting guidelines by the canadian institute of chartered accountants the company said it previously determined a write down of conventional oil and gas properties was not required at september under the previous method of calculating the limitation of oil and gas values dome said the most significant accounting change under the new guidelines is using current oil and gas prices in calculations instead of escalating price forecasts terms of dome s proposed debt restructuring plan preclude the company from making an accurate estimate of future financing costs which are used in the new accounting calculations it said as a result dome adopted current prices and costs and a pct discount factor in the calculations which substantially conform with accounting rules prescribed by the u s securities and exchange commission the company said dome said operating income from its crude oil and natural gas segments fell by billion dlrs to a loss of billion dlrs from prior year earnings of mln dlrs dome said the steep drop in crude oil and natural gas operating income was due to write downs totalling billion dlrs and lower energy prices that sharply reduced revenue reduced production of natural gas and lower utilization of dome s offshore drilling fleet in the beaufort sea also contributed to the decline it said earnings from its natural gas liquids business fell by pct to mln dlrs from mln dlrs in cash from operations dropped to mln dlrs from year ago mln dlrs and unrestricted cash balance declined to mln dlrs from mln dlrs dome said crude oil production in was maintained at prior year s levels through new drilling activity and improvements in productivity natural gas production fell by nine pct as a result of lower domestic and export sales it said oil and field natural gas liquids production totalled barrels a day compared to bpd in the prior year natural gas production fell to mln cubic feet a day from mcf a day reuter,2

conable warns protectionism might spread world bank president barber conable expressed concern that trade protectionism at the heart of a new showdown between the united states and japan might spread throughout the industrial world but in an interview with reuters conable said the action by the united states to slap tariffs on certain electronic goods from japan did not mean the countries were heading for a full scale trade war conable said the world bank has been pressing developing countries to open their markets arguing that a free trading environment increased the possibility of global economic growth we have in fact been making adjustment loans to many countries in the developing world which have encouraged the opening of their markets and we want to be sure that the developed world doesn t close at the same time he said he said the u s action against japan was a significant retaliatory step but it did not constitute a basic change in trade policy the interview came just before next week s semi annual meetings of the bank and the international monetary fund referring to brazil s recent interest payments moratorium conable also said the global debt situation was very serious and must be closely watched he said the bank which in the past has concentrated on making loans that assist the basic underpinnings in the developing world such as dams roads and sewers will increasingly make assistance available for economic reform the bank has increased these loans in part because of the debt crisis that has found countries desperately in need of new funds for balance of payments adjustment and economic reforms aimed at opening their markets encouraging foreign investment and reducing government s role in the economy we re comfortable with adjustment lending we expect however that it will never reach a majority of our portfolio conable said he made clear however that adjustment lending would continue to increase as a proportion of overall bank lending for some time he noted the problem of debt was a severe one and many countries are asking for adjustment assistance because of the problem of debt conable is a a former republican congressman from new york chosen by president reagan for the bank position last year he is an associate of treasury secertary james baker who launched the u s strategy for shoring up indebted nations in october which included a call for increased adjustment lending by the world bank conable also said that he expected the result of a major study of the bank s organization to be completed in the next several weeks he said the decision to seek a reorganization was based in part on the fact that the bank had come under fire from the poorest countries for not doing enough to help and from the richest countries because of inefficiency the reorganization is considered a major initiative by conable and is being closely watched by the agency s member countries as an indication of his management style and priorities i want to be sure this institution is viewed by those who must support it as soundly constituted so that it will be permitted to grow conable said however he said i don t believe there is anything basically wrong with this institution and i don t believe it has to have any redefinition of its purpose he said however that it was apparent that the debt initiative proposed by baker has given the bank a central role in dealing with the debt crisis conable added that cooperation between the bank and its sister agency the international monetary fund was good and that he talked often with imf managing director michel camdessus on a variety of issues on a personal level conable said that he not feel a need to put his personal stamp on the bank noting that i don t have a particular mission here except to be useful to the institution and to the process of development he added so i don t feel a great calling to personalize the institution on the development needs of sub sahara africa conable said that the bank was constantly reviewing new ways for assisting the region noting that half of the recently agreed financing of billion dlrs for bank s international development association was earmarked for africa leading industrial nations are expected to consider new forms of debt relief for the very poorest nations like those in the sub sahara during next week s meetings reuter,7

bahrain introduces new money market regime bahrain is introducing a new domestic money market regime to provide dinar liquidity aid centred on the island s newly launched treasury bill programme the bahrain monetary agency has issued a circular to all commercial banks outlining a new policy from april which gives liquidity aid through sale and repurchase agreements in treasury bills or through discounting them the circular released officially to reuters said current arrangements for providing liquidity aid will no longer be valid except in quite exceptional circumstances under the current system the agency provides the island s commercial banks with dinar liquidity by means of short term swaps against u s dollars and less frequently by short term loans secured against government development bonds the agency considers that it is now appropriate to replace these operations with short term assistance based on government of bahrain treasury bills the circular to banks states the agency said it will repurchase treasury bills with a simultaneous agreement to resell them to the same bank at a higher price which will reflect an interest charge the agency said it envisages the repurchase agreements will normally be for a period of seven days bahrain launched a weekly tender for two mln dinars of day treasury bills in mid december last year and has since raised a total of mln dinars through the programme bahrain s commercial banks are currently liquid and have been making little use of the traditional dollar swaps offered by the agency but banking sources said the new regime from april will mean banks cannot afford not to hold treasury bills in case they need funds from the central bank banking sources said more than half of the banks hold treasury bills although the need by others to take up paper could increase demand at weekly tenders and push down allotted yields slightly last week s yield was six pct although the programme had started at the end of last year with rates as low as pct banking sources said the cost of liquidity through repurchase accords will not differ much from that on dollar swaps but a bank using dollars to obtain liquidity would foresake interest on the u s currency while the underlying treasury bill investment is unaffected in a repurchase accord reuter,5

economic spotlight ems marks eighth birthday the european monetary system marks its eighth anniversary still vulnerable to turmoil in world money markets despite creating an island of currency rate stability in europe economists say but many economists say the system which holds eight european community currencies within narrow fluctuation bands remains in its infancy its new currency the european currency unit ecu has been a runaway success with investors and borrowers alike seeking an alternative to the volatile dollar and on wednesday the long term vision of the ecu as europe s common currency took a step nearer to becoming reality when belgium minted the world s first ecu coin but economists say members such as west germany have so far blocked a second stage of development envisaged by the system s founding fathers ex west german chancellor helmut schmidt and former french president valery giscard d estaing under this phase originally due to have started two years after the ems was set up decision making was to have been transferred from national governments and central banks to an autonomous european monetary fund but members have jealously guarded their sovereignty in economic and monetary matters the basic problem of the ems is that governments are not prepared to make the quantum leap to a situation where certain decisions are taken in common said one economist who has closely watched the system s development the result is that the ec is often divided over policy on third currencies accentuating what the economists say is the system s greatest weakness its vulnerability to a weak dollar over the past months as the u s dollar plunged and investors moved into strong currencies the resulting sharp rise of the west german mark severely strained the system more as the mark soared against the dollar it also rose against ems currencies less favoured by international investors and as west germany last year refused to give in pressure from several ec partners and the united states to cut interest rates to slow the mark s rise the ems had to be realigned twice to ease financial and trade strains within the community two months ago the mark and the dutch guilder were revalued by three pct and the belgian and luxembourg francs by two pct against other currencies in the system the french franc italian lira the irish punt and danish crown another frustration has been britain s failure to lend the ems political support by keeping the pound still a major world currency outside the system no change in the british government s attitude is expected before the country s next general elections due by mid meanwhile the system s last realignment the th since it was set up prompted european finance ministers to ask the ec s highly secretive monetary committee and committee of central bank governors to come up with suggestions for reinforcing it their ideas are due to be unveiled when finance ministers hold an informal meeting in belgium early next month but economists said the proposals are unlikely to involve more than tinkering with technical details they are sceptical about the chances for any fundamental change technical measures won t be enough to protect the ems against external factors such as dollar weakness for that we must take the step forward to the institutional level said leo de corel of kredietbank s economic research department economists say the system s fortunes now will depend largely on the success of an agreement last month among major industrial nations to stabilise exchange rates if the dollar resumes its slide the ems could be in for more turbulence they predict reuter,5
