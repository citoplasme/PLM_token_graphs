"Prolonged neuromuscular blockade with vecuronium in a neonate with renal failure.  An 11-day-old neonate with renal failure caused by dysplastic kidneys was anaesthetised with thiopentone, vecuronium, nitrous oxide and oxygen, for insertion of a long-term peritoneal dialysis catheter.  Complete neuromuscular block of 210 minutes' duration ensued after the initial dose of vecuronium (97 micrograms/kg).  Partial block persisted for a further 30 minutes.  The prolonged neuromuscular block in this case may have been because of proportionately greater dependence on renal clearance of vecuronium in neonates.",11
"Patient acceptance of and satisfaction with an external negative pressure device for impotence.  Patient acceptance of and satisfaction with an external negative pressure device as a treatment for impotence were retrospectively analyzed among 100 men.  The over-all satisfaction rate was 68%.  Reasons for dissatisfaction with and discontinuing the use of the device included premature loss of penile tumescence and rigidity, pain or discomfort either during application of suction or during intercourse and inconvenience.  Negative pressure therapy is an effective treatment for impotence of various etiologies and should be among treatment options offered to the impotent patient.",11
"Submammary median sternotomy.  A vertical skin incision is used as routine approach for sternotomy.  The resulting scar is often disappointing and the top is visible and unpleasant, especially for young women.  In 35 women ranging from 10 to 48 years (mean 29.2 years), median sternotomy was performed via a submammary skin incision.  In all cases an open heart surgical procedure was performed.  Adequate exposure of the heart was achieved in every case and there were no technical problems related to this approach, no hospital mortality or major complications.  The cosmetic result is excellent and this approach is certainly justified in open heart surgery for young women.",16
"Comparison of endometrial biopsy and urinary pregnanediol glucuronide concentration in the diagnosis of luteal phase defect.  To determine if pregnanediol glucuronide (PG) excretion is useful in luteal phase assessment, we compared daily first morning urinary PG concentrations during the luteal phase in nine normal and nine deficient cycles.  Total luteal pregnanediol excretion (44.1 +/- 11.3 versus 64.0 +/- 11.6 area units +/- SEM) was not different.  However, significantly less pregnanediol was excreted by the abnormal group during the 1st 5 days of the luteal phase (12.7 +/- 1.2 versus 18.0 +/- 1.7 area units +/- SEM, respectively).  Thus, delayed PG excretion may be characteristic of luteal phase defect and measurement of urinary PG may be useful only if daily samples during the early luteal phase are obtained.",12
"Efficacy and tolerability of topical terbinafine in the treatment of tinea cruris.  Thirty men with clinical and mycologic evidence of tinea cruris were enrolled in a controlled, randomized, double-blind trial comparing terbinafine 1% cream and its cream vehicle as placebo.  Patients applied the test medications to the affected area twice daily for 2 weeks.  Therapeutic response was evaluable in 18 patients after each week of treatment and at a follow-up visit 2 weeks after therapy ended.  At each visit, terbinafine was found to be more effective than the cream vehicle in the reduction of the signs and symptoms of infection and in the conversion of culture and microscopy findings to negative or normal.  At the end of treatment, therapy was effective in 67% of the nine terbinafine-treated patients compared with only 11% of the nine placebo-treated patients.  At the follow-up examination, efficacy rates were 78% in the terbinafine treatment group and 33% in the placebo group--a difference of borderline statistical significance (p = 0.077).  Possible reasons for this result may include the higher incidence of chronic disease in the terbinafine group and the large number of patients who were classified as delayed exclusions because of negative initial culture for dermatophytes.  No side effects or significant alterations in laboratory or hematologic tests were observed in either treatment group.",0
"Monosodium urate crystals stimulate phospholipase A2 enzyme activities and the synthesis of a phospholipase A2-activating protein.  Eicosanoids are important mediators of the inflammatory response to monosodium urate crystals (MSUC) that results in gout.  Phospholipase enzymes cleave fatty acids from membrane phospholipids, and this is thought to be the rate-limiting step in eicosanoid production.  To understand better the mechanism of eicosanoid production in this disease, we stimulated human peripheral blood neutrophils and monocytes with MSUC and measured phospholipase enzyme activities.  MSUC stimulated both intracellular and secretory phospholipase A2 enzyme activities in a time and concentration-dependent manner.  Specificity was observed, as phospholipase C activities were not affected.  Pretreatment with colchicine, but not aspirin, indomethacin, allopurinol, or islet activating protein, abrogated the enhanced phospholipase A2 activities.  We have recently isolated and characterized a phospholipase A2 activating protein termed PLAP from synovial fluid from patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and from murine and bovine cell lines.  PLAP was detected in gouty synovial fluid by immunodot blotting and ELISA assays and expressed the same characteristics as PLAP identified from other sources.  To examine the role of PLAP in MSUC-induced phospholipase A2 stimulation, we treated cells with MSUC and observed an increase in immunoreactive PLAP.  This response also could be blunted by colchicine, but not other drugs.  Both phospholipase A2 and PLAP induced production by human monocytes of PGE2 and leukotriene B4 by neutrophils.  These findings suggest that phospholipase A2 activation in response to MSUC requires an intact microtubule structure, and that phospholipase A2 and PLAP may be important modulators of at least a portion of the gouty inflammatory response.",4
"Effect of intravenous streptokinase on early mortality in patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction. A meta-analysis by anatomic location of infarction  [published erratum appears in Ann Intern Med 1991 Mar 15;114(6):522]   PURPOSE: To determine the effect of intravenous streptokinase on early mortality in patients with suspected acute anterior and acute inferior myocardial infarctions.  DATA IDENTIFICATION: A literature search of English-language studies on the use of intravenous streptokinase in the treatment of suspected acute myocardial infarction for the period 1966 to 1989 using Medlars II and the bibliographies of relevant articles.  In a number of instances, additional details on early mortality by location of myocardial infarction were provided by the authors.  STUDY SELECTION: Of 140 originally identified articles, 6 that specifically met our inclusion criteria were selected: randomized trials that used intravenous streptokinase in a dose of 1.5 million units, with or without additional agents, compared with a group that differed only by the absence of streptokinase.  Trials were selected by review of the methods section without regard for the results.  DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted independently by two observers using specific methodologic criteria for infarct location and early mortality.  After they conferred, the observers agreed completely on the data.  RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: Among the 9155 patients with suspected acute anterior myocardial infarction, the mortality rate in the control group was 17.4%.  In contrast, patients treated with streptokinase had a 12.5% mortality.  The mean risk difference was -4.8% (95% CI, -7.5% to -2.1%) and the summary risk ratio was 0.72 (CI, 0.65 to 0.79).  A total of 9650 patients with suspected inferior infarction had a mortality rate in the control group of 7.6% [corrected].  The mortality for streptokinase-treated patients was 6.6%.  The mean risk difference was -0.8% (CI, -1.8% to 0.2%) and the summary risk ratio was 0.87 (CI, 0.76 to 1.01).  CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous streptokinase clearly confers a protective effect against early mortality in patients with suspected acute anterior myocardial infarction.  The magnitude of this effect is on the order of a 5% absolute reduction in risk of death by 21 to 35 days.  For these patients, 21 need to be treated to save 1 additional life.  For patients with suspected acute inferior infarction, the benefit of treatment on reducing early mortality is of smaller magnitude and less certain.  These patients have an estimated absolute reduction of early mortality of approximately 1%, which would require treating 125 patients to save 1 additional life.",13
"Hypokalemic and ECG sequelae of combined beta-agonist/diuretic therapy. Protection by conventional doses of spironolactone but not triamterene.  Salbutamol (Albuterol) and diuretics are commonly prescribed together in patients with airflow obstruction and are associated with electrocardiographic effects.  We have now investigated whether the use of potassium-sparing drugs might prevent the ECG sequelae of such combined therapy.  Ten healthy subjects received seven days of randomized treatments with: placebo, bendrofluazide (5 mg), bendrofluazide plus triamterene 50 mg (conventional dose), or triamterene 200 mg (high dose), and bendrofluazide plus spironolactone (100 mg).  Potassium and ECG responses to inhaled salbutamol, 2 mg, were measured after each treatment period.  The T-wave flattening in response to bendrofluazide and salbutamol (0.24[CI, 0.19 to 0.29]mV) was attenuated by the addition of triamterene, 200 mg (0.33[CI, 0.28 to 0.37]mV; p less than 0.05) and spironolactone 100 mg (0.42[CI, 0.37 to 0.47]mV; p less than 0.01), but not by triamterene 50 mg (0.25[CI, 0.20 to 0.30]mV).  Spironolactone and high dose triamterene also diminished the frequency of U waves and ST depression.  The ECG effects mirrored hypokalemic responses which were also blunted by high dose (p less than 0.01) but not low dose triamterene, as well as by spironolactone (p less than 0.001).  Thus, the use of high dose triamterene and spironolactone protected against the hypokalemic and ECG sequelae of combined beta-agonist/diuretic therapy, whereas a conventional dose of triamterene had no effect.  These findings may be important in the prevention of a potentially dangerous interaction in susceptible patients taking this combination of drugs.",17
"Insulin resistance in noncirrhotic idiopathic portal hypertension.  To explore further the pathogenesis of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance observed in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension, we studied a 35-year-old woman with presinusoidal portal hypertension without cirrhosis due to nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver.  After oral glucose ingestion, glucose tolerance remained normal; however, this occurred at the expense of a markedly hyperinsulinemic plasma response, suggesting the presence of insulin resistance.  To examine this question more directly, we performed a stepwise euglycemic insulin clamp study in combination with an infusion of [6-3H]glucose and [1-14C]palmitate and indirect calorimetry.  The ability of insulin to promote total body (primarily muscle) glucose uptake was markedly impaired, whereas its effect to suppress hepatic glucose production was normal compared with results obtained in nine healthy subjects.  Moreover, insulin failed to normally suppress plasma free fatty acid turnover and oxidation in this patient.  This informative case demonstrates that portal hypertension alone, without hepatic dysfunction from cirrhosis, is associated with impaired insulin-mediated glucose and plasma free fatty acid metabolism and may also play a predominant role in the development of insulin resistance in many cirrhotic patients.",5
"Pathophysiologic events related to thermal injury of skin.  Acute thermal injury of skin equivalent to second-degree injury and involving approximately 25% of total body surface results in a series of pathophysiologic events which lead to both local and distant tissue/organ injury.  The distant effects involve intravascular hemolysis and acute lung injury, both of which can be attributed to complement activation and intravascular stimulation of neutrophils, resulting in oxygen radical production, which results in injury of red cells and pulmonary vascular endothelial cells.  At the local site of thermal injury, the progressive increase in vascular permeability is linked to complement activation and histamine release, the outcome of which is interaction of histamine with xanthine oxidase, resulting in enhanced catalytic activity of the enzyme.  Toxic oxygen products of xanthine oxidase, including H2O2 and its conversion product, the hydroxyl radical, appear to be linked to the damage of dermal vascular endothelial cells, resulting in progressive vascular permeability.  The increased vascular permeability can be greatly attenuated by the use of inhibitors of xanthine oxidase, the inhibitor of histamine release (cromolyn), catalase, an iron chelator (deferoxamine), or scavengers of the hydroxyl radical.  Interestingly, neutrophils appear to play little if any role in dermal vascular injury in this animal model of thermal trauma.  Those studies suggest that pathophysiologic events following local thermal trauma are complex and involve a variety of mediator pathways.",20
"Mechanisms of edema formation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. The contribution of inflammatory cells.  Most of the central nervous system (CNS) endothelium regulates the passage of solutes and functions as a blood-brain barrier (BBB).  During experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS, loss of BBB function occurs.  The authors have previously shown an increase in endothelial transcytotic activity associated with decreased mitochondrial content as evidence of BBB dysfunction in EAE.  These changes occurred in the capillary bed and correlated with CNS edema and clinical signs.  In the present report, a fixation procedure before infusion of the intravascular tracer horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in rats at the height of clinical EAE has been used.  In these animals, tracer leakage was only noted in inflamed venules with diameters of 12 to 19 mu.  The authors detected several mechanisms of passive leakage: 1) increased junctional permeability; 2) increased interendothelial space; 3) leakage alongside migrating inflammatory cells.  Some small capillaries showed necrotic changes with minimal tracer leakage.  This report demonstrates that BBB disruption also occurs via nonendocytic mechanisms that may be induced by inflammatory cells.",22
"Sterile versus non-sterile dialysis fluid in chronic hemodialysis treatment.  As the quality of water in the dialysis fluid varies considerably, and in view of the fact that endotoxin or active derivatives can cause acute side effects in patients, the dialysis fluid must be sterile.  Therefore, we introduced ultrafiltration of dialysis fluid before entering the dialyzer.  Fifteen patients, (ten women, five men) were treated for 4 weeks with nonsterile, and then with sterile dialysis fluid.  The bacterial loading in the dialysis fluid before hemodialysis was 1.34 X 10(5)/ml, and after hemodialysis 2.9 X 10(3)/ml; the endotoxin concentration was high and varied between less than 1 EU/ml and greater than 10 EU/ml before and after hemodialysis.  After ultrafiltration of the dialysis fluid by a polyamide hollow fiber membrane, all samples were free of bacteria and the concentration of endotoxin was lower than the detectable limit (less than 0.03 and less than 0.5 EU/ml).  With ultrafiltration of dialysis fluid we can obtain sterile dialysate, which is endotoxin free.  Interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor in the patients with ultrafiltration was significantly lower than without ultrafiltration.",11
"Colonoscopy in critically ill patients. What conditions call for it?  Indications for colonoscopy in the intensive care unit include acute lower intestinal bleeding, sigmoid volvulus, pseudo-obstruction of the colon, and suspicion of pseudomembranous colitis.  Although the incidence of cardiorespiratory complications may be higher in these critically ill patients, the procedure can be done safely with proper attention to detail.  Because of colonic dilatation, endoscopy can often be done without bowel preparation.",5
Immunohistochemical detection of abnormal cell proliferation in colonic mucosa of subjects with polyps.  Previous studies have shown the presence of increased proliferation in the large bowel epithelium of those at high risk of developing colon cancer.  An in vitro technique for labelling large bowel mucosa with the thymidine analogue bromodeoxyuridine (Brdu) was therefore developed and its ability to distinguish differences in mucosal proliferation between subjects with colorectal adenomas and normal controls was assessed.  Sigmoid biopsy specimens from 15 subjects with polyps and 15 age and sex matched controls were labelled and the incorporated Brdu visualised with an immunohistochemical technique.  Mean labelling index (LI) was significantly higher in those with polyps than in controls.  Differences in the pattern of labelling in colonic crypts were compared by the generation of cumulative labelling distributions.  Analysis showed a significant expansion of the proliferative compartment in the colon crypts of those with polyps.  It is concluded that in vitro labelling with Brdu provides a useful method for the assessment of mucosal proliferation in subjects at high risk of developing colon cancer.,5
"Bronchiolar morphology after systemic arterial interruption.  To assess ischemic lesions as a factor in obliterative bronchiolitis after lung transplantation, the authors severed the left bronchial arteries of 15 dogs, together with the left stem bronchus, the latter being immediately reanostomosed.  They examined the bronchioles at weekly interfals up to three and a half months.  On the week chosen each dog was anesthetized, totally heparinized, and exsanguino-perfused with saline.  Just after heart arrest, the thoracic aorta was injected with a barium solution until this white medium appeared in the bronchial arteries.  The heart-lung blocs were excised en bloc, submitted to soft-tissue x ray, fixed, and then sliced to 1 cm.  Corresponding right and left 5-mm-thick samples of these slices were prepared for contact microradiography followed by histologic 5-to-20-micron-thick, stained, correlated specimens.  For two weeks the left bronchial arteries remained empty, but there was no necrosis or edema.  Between two and four weeks barium solution appeared in the bronchial arteries, and the bronchiolar epithelium had become multistratified.  Later the left bronchiangiogram became similar to the right, but there were more folds of the mucosa and a little submucosal fibrosis.  These studies provide proof that no significant ischemic lesions occurred during repermeation of the bronchiolar vascular bed.  Ischemia, if existent, is not a significant factor in obliterative bronchiolitis.",13
"Human tumor fluorouracil trapping: clinical correlations of in vivo 19F nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy pharmacokinetics.  We previously reported that fluorouracil (5FU) accumulation and metabolism in human livers and tumors can be studied by in vivo nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMRS).  We have extended these observations by evaluating the pharmacokinetics of 5FU in the tumors of 11 patients with carcinoma of the breast, colon, endometrium, cervix, and kidney, using 19F-NMRS in a 1.5 Magnetom (Siemens Medical Systems, Cerrito, CA) magnetic resonance imaging unit (MRI).  These NMRS measurements detected a long-lived tumor pool of 5FU in six of 11 tumors in our patients including carcinomas in the pelvis, breast, lung, and liver.  The half-life (T1/2) of this tumor pool of ""trapped"" 5FU was 0.33 to 1.3 hours (20 to 78 minutes), much longer than the T1/2 of 5FU in blood (5 to 15 minutes).  Neither the anabolites of 5FU (fluorinated nucleosides, nucleotides, 5FU-RNA, or 5FU-thymidylate synthase) nor the catabolites (eg, fluorobetaalanine [FBAL]) were detectable by 19F NMRS.  Patient response to chemotherapy appeared to correlate with the extent of trapping of free 5FU in the human tumors: in the seven patients receiving 5FU, or 5FU or FUdR plus leucovorin, four of four patients whose tumors trapped 5FU responded to fluorinated pyrimidine chemotherapy, whereas three patients in whom there was a failure to detect tumor trapping were resistant to 5FU.  We conclude that NMRS is clinically feasible, and enables investigators to study 5FU pharmacokinetics and metabolism in tumors in vivo.  19F-NMRS of 5FU allows for in vivo evaluation of 5FU metabolic modulation and might be able to guide therapeutic decisions.",3
"Late postoperative episodic and constant hypoxaemia and associated ECG abnormalities.  Twenty-two patients without cardiopulmonary disease and undergoing elective major abdominal surgery were monitored continuously with a Holter tape recorder and a pulse oximeter on one night before operation and the first two nights after operation (23:00 to 07:00), without oxygen therapy.  Mean heart rate increased 16 beat min-1 (P less than 0.001) and mean oxygen saturation (SaO2) decreased 2.6% (P less than 0.001) after operation.  Episodic oxygen desaturation to less than 80% occurred in four patients before operation, but in 13 patients after operation (P less than 0.05).  ECG abnormalities were observed in 10 patients before operation and in 16 patients after operation (ns).  Individual maximum ST depression was more pronounced after than before operation (P less than 0.05).  Episodic desaturation was related closely to tachycardia in six patients before operation and one patient after operation; before operation to atrioventricular block in one patient, and after operation to ST depression in two patients.  Mean SaO2 on the second night after operation correlated with total dose of opioid for pain relief (rs = -0.48; P less than 0.05), and postoperative decrease in SaO2 correlated with postoperative increase in heart rate (rs = -0.43; P less than 0.05).  No patient had postoperative cardiac complications indicating treatment.",22
"Vagus nerve stimulation in humans: neurophysiological studies and electrophysiological monitoring.  Evidence from studies of experimental animals indicates that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve alters behavioral and electrographic seizure activity.  We report on effects of electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve in five patients with medically intractable seizures as part of a clinical trial of chronic vagal stimulation for control of epilepsy.  The mechanism of action of the vagal antiepileptic effect is unknown, and it is hoped that analysis of electrophysiological effects of vagal nerve stimulation will help elucidate which brain areas are affected.  Stimulation of the left vagus nerve in the neck was accomplished with a programmable implanted stimulator.  Effects of stimulus amplitude, duration, and rate were studied.  Noncephalic reference recording of the vagus-nerve-evoked potential showed some unusual properties: a scalp negative component occurred with latency of 12 ms, very high amplitude (up to 60 microV), and widespread scalp distribution.  Field distribution studies indicate that this potential is generated in the neck, in the region of the stimulating electrodes.  Muscle paralysis confirms this observation.  Stimulation at various frequencies had no noticeable effect on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity regardless of whether the patient was under general anesthesia, awake, or asleep.",9
"Impaired growth hormone (GH) response to pyridostigmine in type 1 diabetic patients with exaggerated GH-releasing hormone-stimulated GH secretion.  In the present study we investigated the effects of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor pyridostigmine (PD), which is hypothesized to decrease hypothalamic somatostatin tone, alone and in association with GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) on GH secretion in 18 type 1 diabetic patients and 12 normal subjects using a randomized double blind placebo-controlled protocol.  All subjects received either 120 mg oral PD or placebo 60 min before iv injection of either human GHRH-(1-29) NH2 (100 micrograms) or sterile water (2 mL).  In normal subjects both PD alone and GHRH alone caused a significant increase in GH.  PD and GHRH acted in a synergistic fashion when combined.  In diabetic patients the GH response to GHRH was variable.  To segregate the responses, the ratio between the GH increase after GHRH plus PD and after GHRH alone was calculated for each subject.  In 10 diabetic patients (group A) the ratio was lower than 2 SD (P less than 0.05) from the mean response of normal subjects.  These patients showed an exaggerated GH increase after GHRH and a lower GH increase after PD with respect to normal subjects.  Eight diabetic patients (group B) showed a ratio similar to that in normal subjects and similar GH responses to the stimuli.  No significant differences were found between groups A and B with respect to age, body mass index, and blood glucose levels.  Duration of diabetes was longer and basal GH levels were higher in group A.  Hemoglobin-A1c was higher in group A, but of only borderline statistical significance (P = 0.052).  Our data demonstrate that in diabetic patients with exaggerated GH responses to GHRH an increase in cholinergic tone does not affect GH secretion.  These data suggest that in some type 1 diabetic patients an altered somatostatinergic control of GH secretion may contribute to their abnormal GH response to GHRH.",17
"An aid to the management of pediatric trauma in peripheral centers--a proposal for a pediatric trauma board.  In 1986, 630,000 children under the age of 15 were living in Queensland.  This accounted for 17% of Australia's pediatric population.  That year there were 39 pediatric deaths in Queensland resulting from road traffic incidents.  Another 408 injured children were admitted to hospital.  Less than 20% of these children were treated in an accident and emergency (A&E) department staffed by a qualified pediatrician.  Only 35% of the A&E departments were staffed by a qualified emergency physician.  A Pediatric Trauma Board is proposed, which will lead to improvement in the care of injured or critically ill pediatric patients.  This board is made of pre-marked whiteboard and includes normal pediatric values and replacement fluid flow charts; it is approximately three feet in height and six feet in width.  The Board is aimed primarily at nonpediatric clinicians who may or may not be specifically trained or interested in emergency medicine.  It provides quick, easy access to the normal values of vital signs for children of different ages and sizes.  It enables accurate calculation of the fluid requirements for resuscitation and provides a means for following the response to this therapy.  Drug doses per weight are provided.  A copy of the board can be made on size A4 photostats for inclusion in the hospital chart as part of the admission notes.",20
"Itraconazole in tinea versicolor: a review.  Itraconazole, a new orally active triazole antifungal, has been tested in patients with pityriasis versicolor.  A number of studies have shown that itraconazole is effective for this mild fungal skin disease.  The total dose required for effective treatment is 1000 mg, and it has been given as 200 mg for 5 days or 7 days.  The organisms disappear slowly from the skin, even when dead, and the results should be assessed clinically and mycologically at around 3 to 4 weeks after treatment.  Numerous studies have shown that itraconazole is superior to placebo and as effective as selenium sulfide, clotrimazole, and ciclopirox olamine.  It is also better tolerated by patients than selenium sulfide.",0
"Fibrinopeptide A is released into the coronary circulation after coronary spasm.  To examine whether acute myocardial ischemia activates the coagulation system and platelet activation in the coronary circulation, we measured plasma levels of fibrinopeptide A and beta-thromboglobulin in the coronary sinus and the aortic root simultaneously in 15 patients with coronary spastic angina before and after the left coronary spasm induced by intracoronary injection of acetylcholine and in 15 patients with stable exertional angina before and after acute myocardial ischemia induced by rapid atrial pacing.  Fifteen patients with chest pain but normal coronary arteries and no coronary spasm served as controls.  The coronary sinus-arterial difference of fibrinopeptide A increased markedly (p less than 0.001) from 0.1 +/- 0.2 to 4.3 +/- 0.7 ng/ml after the anginal attacks in the coronary spastic angina group.  However, fibrinopeptide A levels remained unchanged after the attacks in the stable exertional angina group and after intracoronary injection of acetylcholine in the control group.  Plasma beta-thromboglobulin levels remained unchanged after the attacks in both patient groups and after acetylcholine in the control group.  Our data indicate that coronary spasm induces thrombin generation and may lead to thrombus formation in the coronary artery involved, but pacing-induced ischemia does not activate the coagulation system.",13
"Prognostic value of c-myc proto-oncogene overexpression in early invasive carcinoma of the cervix.  The prognostic effect of c-myc oncogene overexpression was assessed in a multivariate analysis of 93 patients with invasive carcinoma of the cervix, stage Ib, IIa, and IIb proximal.  The treatment was based on the association of brachytherapy-colpohysterectomy and lymphadenectomy.  Analysis of c-myc gene expression was done using Northern and slot blot hybridization techniques.  Overexpression of c-myc (ie, levels at least three times the mean observed in normal tissues) was present in 33% of the tumors.  The proportion of carcinomas with c-myc overexpression significantly increased with the size of the primary tumor (P = .04).  No relationship was found between c-myc overexpression and the other clinical and histologic parameters, including the nodal status.  The relative risk of relapse (overall, pelvic failure, distant metastases) was analyzed in a Cox's proportional hazards model.  Three factors were significantly related to the risk of overall relapse when the multivariate analysis was performed, namely, the tumor size, the nodal status, and c-myc expression.  A combination of c-myc expression and the nodal status provided a very accurate indication of the risk of relapse.  Indeed, patients with negative nodes had a 3-year disease-free survival rate of 93% (95% confidence interval [Cl], 79% to 98%) when c-myc was expressed at a normal level, whereas this rate was only 51% (95% Cl, 26% to 63%) when c-myc was overexpressed (log-rank test, P = .02).  In addition, in the subgroup of patients with positive nodes, this rate was 44% (95% Cl, 25% to 77%) and 15% (95% Cl, 4% to 49%) when c-myc gene was expressed at normal level, or overexpressed, respectively.  Finally, c-myc gene overexpression was, in the multivariate analysis, the first factor selected by the model regarding the risk of distant metastases.",3
"Doxorubicin for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. A prospective study on the addition of verapamil.  A prospective study was conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of the addition of oral verapamil to intravenous Adriamycin (doxorubicin) for the management of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).  All 28 patients studied had histologically verified disease, and cirrhosis was present in 20 of the 21 patients with adequate tissue sampling.  The overall median survival was 57 days.  Chemotherapy was terminated in seven patients after one course of treatment.  Partial response and complete response were noted in four patients (19%) and one patient (4.8%), respectively, among the 21 patients evaluated.  Side effects related to the chemotherapy were present in all patients studied.  Death from fulminating sepsis occurred in three of the 13 patients with leukopenia.  Symptomatic myocardial dysfunction developed in one patient.  The addition of verapamil apparently did not potentiate the tumoricidal effect of systemic Adriamycin on HCC but probably did increase its complications.",3
"Nature, nurture, nutrition: interdisciplinary programs to address the prevention of malnutrition and dehydration.  Malnutrition and dehydration are common problems in nursing home patients.  One explanation for this may be the large number of patients requiring feeding assistance.  The Dysphagia Team at the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Miami, Florida served as the primary source in the expansion of a nutritionally supportive environment to assist in the prevention of malnutrition and dehydration in patients with feeding/swallowing disorders.  ""Silver Spoons,"" a program in which volunteers provide supervised feeding, ""Happy Hour,"" a time each day during which an atmosphere is provided that encourages socialization and hydration, and ""Second Seating,"" during which lunch is provided for patients who require modification of eating style, food texture, or timing are described.  Analysis of the program's outcomes show it to be timely, pleasing to patients, and cost-effective.",17
"Effects of prostaglandin I2, superoxide dismutase, and catalase on ischemia-reperfusion injury in liver transplantation.  This study evaluated the effects of a prostaglandin I2 analogue (aPGI2), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) on hepatic injury after warm ischemia and reperfusion in terms of survival, mitochondrial function, serum enzymes, and histology.  Hepatic ischemia was created in rats by clamping the hepatoduodenal ligament for 90 min with splenofemoral bypass.  Reperfusion was induced by unclamping the vessels and disconnecting the splenofemoral bypass.  Then aPGI2 (350 ng/kg/min) was infused for 60 min just before hepatic ischemia, and SOD and CAT (5,000 units/kg each) were administered immediately before the start of reperfusion.  Serum enzyme and mitochondrial function assessments of livers were made just after ischemia, and after 2 hr of reperfusion.  Survival rate was also assessed in a separate group of rats.  Liver enzymes such as SGOT, SGPT, and LDH showed no correlation to liver viability.  The administration of aPGI2 alone showed no effect on ischemically injured mitochondria; however, the free radical scavengers (SOD, CAT), in combination with aPGI2, showed significant improvement of mitochondrial function together with extension of survival.  The ultrastructure of hepatocytes was better preserved in the treated groups.  These agents improved the viability of ischemic-reperfused injured livers.",22
"Peritoneal fluid fractions from patients with endometriosis do not promote two-cell mouse embryo growth.  Peritoneal fluid (PF) from 10 infertile patients with endometriosis, obtained during the follicular phase of the cycle during laparoscopy, did not promote two-cell mouse embryo growth to the extent observed by fluid obtained from seven normal controls.  Five molecular weight (MW) fractions were obtained by ultrafiltration, and each was used as media supplement in the assay and compared with PF fractions from normal controls.  All fractions of PF from patients with endometriosis inhibited mouse embryo growth to a greater extent than did normal controls.  However, the MW fractions greater than 100,000 daltons showed greater inhibition of embryo development than did fractions less than 100,000 daltons.  This study of cell-free PF suggests the presence of a humoral factor greater than 100,000 daltons that is inhibitory on mouse embryo growth.",12
"Alcoholism and society.  The problems of alcohol abuse are rampant in society and permeate the Emergency Department experience.  The cost to society as measured by social, medical, occupational, and legal effects is exceedingly high and probably underestimated.  Emergency physicians have the opportunity to intervene in this vicious cycle and must learn their role in the process.",20
"Pediatric spondyloarthropathies.  Seronegative spondyloarthropathies in childhood are often misdiagnosed as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, but recognition of their distinct clinical manifestations and unique underlying pathophysiologies can aid in making a proper diagnosis.  Ankylosing spondylitis, Reiter's syndrome, psoriatic arthritis, and the arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease are arthritides most often found in young adults, but they may also be present in children.  Extraarticular manifestations include inflammation of the eyes, skin, gastrointestinal tract, and genitourinary tract associated with inflammation of the entheses.  The proper diagnosis will allow for treatment regimens that differ from those usually used for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.  Early diagnosis and treatment often lead to an early recovery and a return to normal daily activities.",4
"A randomized comparison of manipulation of the fractured nose under local and general anaesthesia.  Reduction of simple nasal fractures may be performed under local or general anaesthesia: the latter is by far the most popular method in Britain, though why is hard to define.  We have attempted to compare the 2 approaches by means of a randomized, prospective trial.  Fifty consecutive, adult patients with radiologically proved fractures of the nasal bones were randomized to a local or general anaesthesia group and underwent manipulation with Asch's and Walsham's forceps between 7 and 15 days post-injury.  Analysis of results at 4 h and 8 weeks post-operatively showed no significant benefit conferred by fracture reduction under general anaesthesia as opposed to local anaesthesia with respect to post-operative airway patency or cosmesis.  It is suggested that significant benefits can be obtained in terms of patient convenience and cost effectiveness if nasal fractures are reduced under local anaesthesia as an outpatient procedure.",9
"Requirement of endogenous tumor necrosis factor/cachectin for recovery from experimental peritonitis.  By intrasplenic immunization we raised a rat mAb (mAb V1q; IgG2a, kappa) with a potent neutralizing activity against natural mouse TNF (1 microgram/ml mAb V1q/100 U/ml TNF).  mAb V1q was used to study the role of endogenous TNF in experimental peritonitis induced by sublethal cecal ligation and puncture.  mAb V1q persisted for over 5 days in the serum of mice injected with 100 micrograms of the antibody and, therefore, proved useful for in vivo experiments.  As little as 20 micrograms mAb V1q/mouse prevented lethal shock of the animals by 400 micrograms LPS/mouse.  In sublethal cecal ligation and puncture i.p.  injection of mAb V1q directly and up to 8 h after induction of experimental peritonitis lead to death of the animals within 1 to 3 days.  The lethal effect of mAb V1q was compensated by injection of recombinant mouse TNF.  Similar mAb V1q effects as in immunocompetent mice were shown in severe combined immune deficiency mice deficient of mature functional B and T cells.  Taken together, these data suggest that during the early phase of peritonitis endogenous TNF may stimulate nonlymphoid cells such as granulocytes, macrophages, platelets, and fibroblasts to ingest bacteria and to localize inflammation, respectively.  These beneficial effects of TNF may determine survival.  Thus, our data may have implications for the therapeutic management of a beginning peritonitis.",5
"Design mediated thrombus reduction in the Utah-100 total artificial heart.  The Utah-100 total artificial heart was initially designed and tested in 1983.  General design goals, including improved fit for human application, improved reliability, and elimination of thrombus formation, were identified as improvements over the clinically used Jarvik-7 artificial heart, previously developed at the Institute for Biomedical Engineering, University of Utah.  Specific design goals included 1) elimination of connector and valve-associated thrombus formation and 2) elimination of gross mineralization, thrombus formation, and creases on the blood-pumping diaphragm of the device.  Explant retrieval results from 29 calves and sheep implanted with the Jarvik-7 artificial heart were compared with results from 25 calves and sheep implanted with the Utah-100 artificial heart.  Macroscopic thrombus formation was found in 44% of the connectors of the Jarvik-7 artificial-hearts, compared with 2% (p less than or equal to 0.01) in animals with the Utah-100 artificial heart.  Subvalvular and supravalvular thrombi were observed in 33% of the valves in the Jarvik-7 artificial heart and 10% (p less than or equal to 0.01) of the valves in the Utah-100 artificial heart.  Mineralization of the pumping diaphragm was observed in 12% of the animals implanted with the Jarvik-7 artificial heart and in 4% of the animals with the Utah-100 diaphragms.  Thrombus formation in the diaphragm-housing interface occurred in 2% of Jarvik-7 ventricles and in 6% of the Utah-100 ventricles.  There were no identifiable diaphragm creases in the Utah-100 diaphragms, but a 10% incidence was found in Jarvik-7 devices.  These results validate substantial progress toward improved design and fabrication methods in the Utah-100 total artificial heart.",13
"Prospective evaluation of gastric emptying in the self-poisoned patient.  The authors prospectively studied the effect of gastric emptying (GE) and activated charcoal (AC) upon clinical outcome in acutely self-poisoned patients.  Presumed overdose patients (n = 808) were treated using an alternate day protocol based on a 10-question cognitive function examination and presenting vital sign parameters.  Asymptomatic patients (n = 451) did not receive GE.  AC was administered to asymptomatic patients only on even days.  GE in the remaining symptomatic patients (n = 357) was performed only on even days.  On emptying days, alert patients had ipecac-induced emesis while obtunded patients received gastric lavage.  AC therapy followed gastric emptying.  On nonemptying days, symptomatic patients were treated only with AC.  No clinical deterioration occurred in the asymptomatic patients treated without GE.  AC use did not alter outcome measures in asymptomatic patients.  GE procedures in symptomatic patients did not significantly alter the length of stay in the emergency department, mean length of time intubated, or mean length of stay in the intensive care unit.  Gastric lavage was associated with a higher prevalence of medical intensive care unit admissions (P = .0001) and aspiration pneumonia (P = .0001).  The data support the management of selected acute overdose patients without GE and fail to show a benefit from AC in asymptomatic overdose patients.",20
"An effective and adaptable transvenous defibrillation system using the coronary sinus in humans.  With use of a coronary sinus catheter electrode, a right ventricular catheter electrode and a chest wall patch electrode system, defibrillation threshold voltage, current and energy were measured with four distinct transvenous defibrillation techniques delivered in random sequence in each of 12 survivors of cardiac arrest immediately before implantation of a standard epicardial patch defibrillation system.  The four transvenous defibrillation techniques were 1) single pathway monophasic pulsing, 2) single pathway biphasic pulsing, 3) dual pathway sequential pulsing, and 4) dual pathway simultaneous pulsing.  A transvenous defibrillation method was considered to be potentially useful only if the defibrillation threshold was less than or equal to 500 V (less than or equal to 15 J delivered energy).  The 500 V value would allow a 2:1 defibrillation safety margin for a device with a maximal output of 30 J.  No single transvenous pulsing technique was uniformly superior in efficacy.  However, by choosing the best pulsing technique for each patient, it was possible to obtain an average defibrillation threshold of 410 +/- 135 V leading edge voltage, 7.2 +/- 2.5 A leading edge current and 11.3 +/- 7.4 J delivered energy for the group of 12 patients.  With the ability to vary defibrillation technique, transvenous antiarrhythmic device implantation would have been possible in 10 (83%) of the 12 patients at or below a 15 J defibrillation threshold cutoff point.  In contrast, if only one transvenous defibrillation method had been used, as few as 5 and at most 8 of the 12 patients would have been candidates for a transvenous defibrillation system given a 15 J defibrillation threshold cutoff point for insertion.",22
"Biopsy of the breast for mammographically detected lesions.  We prospectively studied 718 women who underwent biopsy of the breast for suspicious, mammographically detected mammary lesions in an attempt to identify key clinical risk factors, as well as roentgenographic characteristics associated with the appearance of early carcinoma of the breast.  Patients with a benign outcome had an average age of 55 years versus 63 years for patients with carcinoma of the breast.  Seventy-six per cent of these patients had no previous history of mammary problems, 20 per cent had a positive family history for carcinoma of the breast, 58 per cent were premenopausal and 21 per cent had used birth control pills.  Except for age (p less than 0.001), the distribution of clinical risk factors was equal among patients with benign or malignant outcomes.  Suspicious mammographic findings included mass lesions (53 per cent), calcifications (36 per cent) and the association of both (11 per cent).  The predominant Wolfe pattern on mammography was P1 (36 per cent).  No relationship was observed between Wolfe pattern and malignant conditions.  In this group of patients, mammography was poorly specific; however, the positive predictive value increased with age and is related to the age-specific prevalence of carcinoma of the breast.  Eight hundred and twenty-five lesions were removed.  Twenty-five per cent (n = 203) of the specimens taken at biopsy contained carcinoma.  Stellate mass lesions were highly suggestive of a malignant growth (p less than 0.0001).  No relationship between the size of the suspicious mammographic mass and the malignant lesion was observed.  A marked correlation (chi-square test with Yate's correction) was observed between malignant tumor and lesions with a linear or branching pattern, more than 15 calcifications, or small sized calcifications.  The presence of a mass with calcifications was associated with carcinoma in 34 per cent.  The incidence of invasive carcinoma was much higher for mass lesions (81 per cent) than for suspicious calcifications (56 per cent) (p less than 0.0001).",3
Metoprolol for aggressive behavior in persons with mental retardation.  Persons with mental retardation sometimes exhibit behaviors that are difficult to control.  Use of neuroleptic medications may be limited by side effects or ineffectiveness.  Beta blockers such as propranolol and metoprolol have been shown to decrease aggressive and impulsive behaviors in some patients with mental retardation.,9
"An implantable neurocybernetic prosthesis system.  The neurocybernetic prosthesis (Cyberonics, Inc.) is an implantable, multiprogrammable pulse generator that delivers constant current electrical signals to the vagus nerve for the purpose of reducing the frequency and/or severity of epileptic seizures.  The device is implanted in a subcutaneous chest pocket just below the clavicle, similar to cardiac pacemaker placement.  The stimulation signal is transmitted from the prosthesis to the vagus nerve through a stimulation lead.  The prosthesis can be programmed using any IBM-compatible personal computer with programming software and a programming wand.  The electrodes used in the first group of patients were found to break at an unacceptable rate.  Design modifications appear to have resolved this problem.",9
"Small fenestra stapedotomy using a fiberoptic hand-held argon laser in obliterative otosclerosis.  Obliterative otosclerosis has been a challenge since the advent of stapes surgery.  ""Drill-out"" procedures have had a generally poorer prognosis than conventional stapes surgery because of excessive bleeding, acoustic trauma from the burr, and reclosure of the oval window by otosclerosis.  In this report, we describe our early experience using a hand-held fiberoptic argon laser for small fenestra stapedotomy in 10 cases of obliterative otosclerosis.  Closure of the air-bone gap to within 10 dB was seen in 100% of the patients.  There was no significant sensorineural hearing loss, vertigo, or facial weakness.  Argon-laser stapedotomy using a hand-held fiberoptic system is a safe and effective alternative to drill-out stapedotomy in cases of obliterative otosclerosis.",8
"Dysequilibrium and otitis media with effusion: what is the association?  An association between non-suppurative otitis media (NSOM) and symptoms of dysequilibrium has been observed but not previously quantified in children (Gates, 1980; Busis, 1983; Blayney and Coleman, 1984).  This study compared the incidence of balance related problems in 154 children with surgically proven glue ear and 51 children with normal ear function.  Symptoms ranging from true vertigo to mild ataxia were discovered in 22 per cent of the children with NSOM but in none of those within the control group (p less than 0.001).  Periods of dysequilibrium were associated with episodes of otalgia in 64 per cent of the children but were not increased in those with unilateral compared to those with bilateral effusions.  Complete resolution of symptoms occurred in 85 per cent of children following the insertion of grommets.  A history of balance disturbance should be actively sought in all children with otitis media with effusion, and when present, provides a strong indication for early operative intervention.",8
"Circulatory and thermal adjustments to prolonged exercise in paraplegic women.  The circulatory and thermal responses to 90 min of wheelchair ergometer exercise were examined in five wheelchair dependent (WD) women with low level spinal dysfunction and five able-bodied (AB) women who served as a comparison group.  Metabolic rate during exercise was 221 W for WD and 255 W for AB (P greater than 0.05).  Oral temperature (Tor), mean skin temperature (Tsk), oxygen uptake (VO2), heart rate (HR), and cardiac output (Qc) were assessed periodically throughout the exercise period.  Ambient conditions were 24-25 degrees C and 38-52% relative humidity.  A significant group X time interaction was found for Tor (P less than 0.001) and Tsk (P less than 0.001).  Tor of the WD group steadily increased during the exercise, whereas the AB group showed a stable Tor.  Tsk of WD increased rapidly during the first 5-10 min of exercise and continued to rise at a slower rate throughout the exercise.  In contrast, Tsk of AB rose to a peak during the first 10 min and then showed a decreasing trend.  VO2 and HR remained stable in both groups throughout the exercise period.  Following an initial increase in Qc from minute 10 to minute 20 in both groups, values for WD continually decreased until Qc at 80 min was 14% lower than at 10 min.  The findings suggest that the WD women had greater thermoregulatory strain than the AB women as indicated by a higher Tor and Tsk and by an inability to maintain Qc due to paralysis of the lower limbs and perhaps an increase in cutaneous blood volume.",9
"Conjugated catecholamines in human plasma: where are they coming from?  The origins of conjugated catecholamines remain poorly known.  The aim of the present study was to see whether a major contribution comes from the sympathetic nervous system.  We have assumed some kind of parallelism between the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, the amount of catecholamines released and taken up, and the amount of conjugated catecholamines circulating in plasma.  Accordingly, an increase in sympathetic activity should be followed by an increase in the plasma level of conjugated catecholamines.  The plasma levels of sulfoconjugated and glucuroconjugated catecholamines were measured in 10 patients with mental disease resistant to drug treatment, before and after electroconvulsive therapy.  As expected, blood pressure, norepinephrine concentration, and epinephrine concentration in plasma were transiently increased.  Neither sulfoconjugated nor glucuroconjugated catecholamines were significantly changed.  Conjugated catecholamines were measured in 10 volunteers before and at the nadir of insulin-induced hypoglycemia.  As expected, plasma levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine were drastically increased.  Plasma levels of sulfoconjugates were decreased and glucuroconjugates increased; these were narrow but statistically significant variations.  Data reported in the present article do not support a major role for the activity of the sympathetic system in fixing the level of conjugated catecholamines in human plasma.  This is a negative, but nonetheless important, observation.  In human subjects, currently available information suggests an important role for the intestinal wall and renal function in determining the level of circulating sulfoconjugates.",17
"Intraoperative transesophageal versus epicardial ultrasound in surgery for congenital heart disease.  Twenty-eight patients (age range, 0.7 to 65 years; median age, 6.1 years) who were undergoing correction for congenital heart disease were entered into a prospective study with both intraoperative transesophageal and epicardial ultrasound to determine the relative values of these techniques before and after bypass surgery.  Introduction of the transesophageal probe was successful in 26 patients (93%); children were studied with use of dedicated pediatric transducers.  Epicardial studies were performed in all 28 patients.  Epicardial studies allowed for higher resolution imaging and a more complete assessment before bypass surgery of the intracardiac morphological condition (ventricular septum and right ventricular outflow tract) than the assessment that was obtained by the transesophageal approach.  In the period immediately after bypass surgery, the transesophageal technique allowed a more detailed insight into atrioventricular valve function (valvar regurgitation [five patients] and ventricular inflow patterns) and the continuous monitoring of left ventricular function and volume.  Residual interventricular shunting (three patients) or residual outflow tract obstruction (four patients) could not be reliably documented by transesophageal studies.  It is concluded that intraoperative transesophageal and epicardial ultrasound in surgery for congenital heart disease are complementary rather than alternative techniques.",15
"Regression of infundibular pulmonary stenosis after successful balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty in adults.  Between July 1985 and March 1988, 22 adult patients with congenital pulmonary stenosis underwent balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty.  There were 10 males and 12 females aged 16-45 (average 25 +/- 9.9) years.  All patients had additional mild to severe infundibular stenosis; 16 were restudied 6-36 (mean 12.6) months later by repeat catheterization.  Student's t-test was used for comparison of data.  Right ventricular (RV) systolic pressure before dilatation was 84-196 (mean 129 +/- 32.3) mm Hg, and the peak pulmonary gradient (PPG) was 60-176 (mean 111 +/- 33.2) mm Hg immediately after dilatation.  The RV systolic pressure dropped to 32-140 (mean 59.2 +/- 27) (P less than 0.001); and PPG dropped to 10-113 (mean 37.8 +/- 26.4) (P less than 0.001), and the infundibular gradient ranged from 8 to 113 (mean 35.1 +/- 25.8) mm Hg.  The infundibular diameter, before dilatation, ranged from 2 to 15 (mean 9.5 +/- 4) mm Hg.  At repeat catheterization, the RV systolic pressure dropped further to 33-66 (mean 42.8 +/- 9.7) mm Hg and the PPG was reduced to 0-48 (mean 18.4 +/- 10.9) mm Hg (P less than 0.001).  The infundibular gradient regressed to 0-34 (mean 15 +/- 8.8) mm Hg (P less than 0.001).  The infundibular diameter increased to 8-25 (mean 15.8 +/- 5.4) (P less than 0.001).  It is concluded that moderate to severe infundibular stenosis, in adults, can regress after successful pulmonary valvuloplasty.",13
"Identification of the driver in two-rider motorcycle accidents. Inguinal contusion-laceration as an indication of the driver.  In motorcycle accidents involving two riders, medicolegal identification of the driver is necessary when one or both riders die.  It is particularly important in the latter case, because the survivor almost always insists that he or she was not driving.  One characteristic injury that distinguishes the driver from the passenger is inguinal contusion-laceration (accompanied internally by pelvic fracture).  This injury, caused by collision of the pelvis with the fuel tank, identifies the driver.",20
"Effect of beta-adrenergic blocking agents on the circadian occurrence of ischemic cardiovascular events.  Clinical observations suggest that beta-adrenergic blocking agents can modify the circadian occurrence of a variety of ischemic events.  Morning awakening is associated with a rapid increase in blood pressure and pulse, serum catecholamine content and platelet activation, at a time of decreased blood thrombolytic activity.  Beta-adrenergic blocking agents have the potential to modify many of these events.  Current data indicate that these agents modify blood pressure and pulse, but do not prevent their early morning increase.  In addition, beta-adrenergic blocking agents decrease ventricular ectopy and its circadian variation.  Recent studies in humans indicate, however, that metoprolol does not affect the circadian increase in platelet activity or serum catecholamines.  The specific mechanism by which beta blockers affect the circadian occurrence of ischemic events remains uncertain.",13
"Effects of endotracheal suctioning on mixed venous oxygen saturation and heart rate in critically ill adults.  The purpose of this multisite study was to determine the effects of endotracheal suctioning on mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) and heart rate in 189 critically ill adults.  One-pass, intermittent suction was applied for 10 or fewer seconds, with three prehyperoxygenation and three posthyperoxygenation breaths of 100% oxygen.  Subjects at three hospitals (n = 127) underwent suctioning using hyperoxygenation with anesthesia bags and traditional suction catheters (open suction method).  Subjects at one hospital (n = 62) underwent suctioning with hyperoxygenation by ventilator and in-line suction catheters (closed suction method).  For subjects from all hospital sites combined, the SvO2 decreased from 67% to 64% (p = 0.001), a 4% change from baseline, and returned to baseline within 2 minutes.  However, in subjects receiving the open method of suction, SvO2 dropped from 66% to 62% immediately after suctioning and returned to baseline within 4 minutes.  In contrast, when the closed suction method was used, SvO2 rose from 67.7% to 67.86% immediately after suctioning, drifting upward to 71% for the next 2 minutes before dropping toward the baseline after 4 minutes.  Mean heart rate increased from a baseline of 99 beats/min to 104 beats/min immediately after suctioning (p = 0.001), a 5% change from baseline, and gradually returned to baseline over the next 4 minutes.  No significant differences were seen in heart rate between subjects having the open versus closed suction method.  In conclusion, the closed suction method showed a higher SvO2 after endotracheal suctioning compared with the open suction method (p = 0.0001).  Some form of hyperoxygenation before and after endotracheal suctioning is recommended.",22
"Effects of intracavernosal trazodone hydrochloride: animal and human studies.  Trazodone hydrochloride is an oral antidepressant agent which has been associated with the improvement of erections in impotent men and the development of prolonged erections or priapism in potent men.  An in vivo study in animal and human subjects was performed to gain experience with the effect of intracavernosal trazodone.  In the anesthetized New Zealand White rabbit, intracavernosal trazodone or its major metabolite m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP) produced full penile erection in 76% and 84% of animals studied respectively with doses ranging from one to 15 mg.  On the other hand, intracavernosal administration of five mg.  papaverine resulted in a prolonged erection in 90% of animals studied.  In 13 selected volunteer patients, intracavernosal trazodone caused tumescence but not full penile erection with corporal body pressures of 28.2 +/- 5.8 mm.  Hg.  Intracavernosal papaverine or papaverine and phentolamine in these subjects resulted in significantly higher corporal body pressures of 58 +/- 18 mm.  Hg (p less than .05).  Intracavernosal administration of alpha adrenoceptor agonists but not normal saline resulted in complete detumescence of trazodone- or m-CPP-induced prolonged erection in the animal studies.  Intracavernosal trazodone results in erectile activity that appears in part based on its local alpha blocking activity but like other intracavernosal alpha-blocking agents is not as effective in initiating penile erections as are intracavernosal agents that directly induce smooth muscle relaxation.",11
"Evaluation of neonatal subglottic stenosis: a 3-year prospective study.  Subglottic stenosis is the most common cause of chronic airway obstruction.  It results in prolonged tracheal cannulation of infants and children.  Following the widespread adoption over the past 20 years of prolonged intubation for respiratory support in neonates, the incidence of acquired subglottic stenosis increased dramatically.  On January 1, 1987, we began a 3-year prospective study to delineate potential etiologic factors involved in the development of subglottic stenosis in neonates.  The present study analyzes data from 289 infants.  Relationships between birth weight, gestational age, endotracheal tube size, duration of intubation and ventilation, number and difficulty of intubations, and the subsequent need for medical and surgical therapy are discussed.  Whole organ larynges from autopsy specimens provide histological correlation.",8
"Effects of brief coronary occlusion and reperfusion on porcine coronary artery reactivity.  The loss of coronary vasodilator reserve after ischemia-reperfusion may be due to endothelial injury, and this vascular dysfunction may contribute to functional alterations observed after ischemia.  To determine whether endothelial dysfunction occurs after relatively brief periods of moderate low-flow ischemia in vivo, open-chest swine were subjected to 15 minutes of critical, subtotal left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion (80%) followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion.  Serial measurements of regional coronary flow were made with the radiolabeled microsphere technique.  After 60 minutes of reperfusion, the left anterior descending coronary artery was excised together with a section of the normally perfused left circumflex coronary artery to examine in vitro the relaxations to the endothelium-dependent dilators ADP and bradykinin and to the endothelial-independent dilators sodium nitroprusside and adenosine.  Contractions to serotonin in quiescent rings were also examined.  Endocardial and transmural blood flows recovered to preocclusion levels within 60 minutes of reperfusion, as did the epicardial-to-endocardial ratio.  Vascular responses in isolated, reperfused left anterior descending coronary artery rings were significantly different from responses in control left circumflex coronary artery rings.  Endothelium-dependent relaxations to adenosine diphosphate and bradykinin were significantly depressed in the left anterior descending coronary artery rings compared with left circumflex coronary artery rings (p less than 0.05).  Serotonin-induced contractions were significantly greater in occluded-reperfused left anterior descending than in left circumflex coronary arteries (p less than 0.05).  Relaxations to adenosine and sodium nitroprusside were not significantly different between the two groups.",13
"Tampon absorbency, composition and oxygen content and risk of toxic shock syndrome.  Tampon use has been identified as a major risk factor for toxic shock syndrome, although the etiologic role of tampons is not clearly understood.  Two epidemiologic studies conducted to date have reported an association between tampon absorbency and risk of toxic shock syndrome.  This finding is not corroborated by laboratory studies, however, which have suggested that absorbency may be a marker for other characteristics that create an environment conductive to the elaboration of toxic shock syndrome toxin 1.  We used data from the previously reported Tri-state study to estimate simultaneously the effects of tampon oxygen content, absorbency and chemical composition.  Although the data are sparse, oxygen content was more strongly associated with risk of toxic shock syndrome than either absorbency or chemical composition.  The results suggest that it may be possible to develop a highly absorbent tampon that is not associated with a high risk of toxic shock syndrome.",0
"Clinical use of the Berlin Biventricular Assist Device as a bridge to transplantation.  The Berlin Artificial Heart System/Biventricular Assist Device (BVAD) was used in 38 patients.  1) Twenty-eight patients were awaiting cardiac transplantation (Tx) (age 23-56 yrs).  All patients had contraindications not allowing immediate Tx.  2) Five patients were emergency cases not on our Tx list (postcardiotomy cardiac failure, acute myocarditis) (age 28-59).  3) Five patients were post Tx patients with graft failure (age 22-52).  Extracorporal circulation was used for implantation of the BVAD.  In group 1, 21 of 28 patients (pts) recovered, and all were subsequently transplanted after 6 hours to 39 days, when all organ function was restored.  In 7 pts, mechanical circulation was terminated after 1-40 days because of further deterioration.  Five of the transplanted pts died, 14 pts survived (greater than 30 days), and 2 pts were just transplanted with satisfactory postoperative courses.  Of group 2 and 3 pts, two were successfully weaned.  In one patient the allograft recovered after 11 days of support.",13
"Inter- and intraindividual variation in pressure-volume relations of the rectum in normal subjects and patients with the irritable bowel syndrome.  The relation between intrarectal volume and pressure during increasing rectal distension by a latex balloon were studied on repeated occasions in 10 healthy adult volunteers to define variations within and between individuals.  A wide intersubject variation in the maximum tolerable volume (58-908 ml) and pressure (12.2-108.8 cm H2O) at this end point was seen, and these two values were correlated (r = 0.78).  Intrasubject variation in maximum tolerable volume also occurred which was related to study order and progressively reduced with repeated study.  In 26 unselected patients with pain predominant irritable bowel syndrome similar intersubject variation was noted and virtually all patients data fell within the calculated 95% confidence limits of the normal individuals.  Differentiation between patients and normal subjects was not possible from knowledge of rectal responses.  These noticeable inter- and intrasubject variations in rectal responses to distension need to be considered whenever similar techniques are proposed for use in the study of rectal disease or of rectal response to treatment.",5
"A multicenter analysis of percutaneous discectomy.  This study was performed to evaluate a group of patients undergoing percutaneous discectomy.  All patients had a single level unilateral L4-5 or L5-S1 disc herniation documented on either computer tomographic (CT) scan, myelogram, and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  Average follow-up after percutaneous discectomy was 16.8 months (range, 2-46 months).  The average hospitalization time was 1.7 days (range, 1-5 days).  Only 21 patients (55%) were able to return to work after the procedure.  Thirteen patients ultimately underwent surgical discectomy for continued symptoms after the procedure.  The additional 4 patients did not undergo surgical discectomy and never returned to work.  Of those 25 percutaneous discectomy patients who did not undergo surgical discectomy, there was significantly more pain, residual weakness, and numbness compared with the patients undergoing surgical discectomy.  The results of this study clearly indicate that percutaneous discectomy does not appear to be as predictable or successful a treatment modality as surgical discectomy.",4
"Race, nutritional status, and survival from breast cancer.  The effects of nutritional status on differences in the survival of black and white women with breast cancer were studied in a cohort of 1,960 Georgia women diagnosed during 1975-1979.  After data were adjusted for stage of disease, socioeconomic status, and other prognostic factors, poorer survival rates were shown in black women.  Within each stage classification, lower levels of serum albumin and hemoglobin and higher relative body weight were more common among blacks and were independently associated with poorer survival.  Among women with stage 3 disease, adjustment for these variables substantially reduced the excess mortality rate among blacks, suggesting that racial differences in survival may be partly explained by differences in nutritional status or extent of disease within stage.",3
"Fluctuation in timing of upper airway and chest wall inspiratory muscle activity in obstructive sleep apnea.  An imbalance in the amplitude of electrical activity of the upper airway and chest wall inspiratory muscles is associated with both collapse and reopening of the upper airway in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).  The purpose of this study was to examine whether timing of the phasic activity of these inspiratory muscles also was associated with changes in upper airway caliber in OSA.  We hypothesized that activation of upper airway muscle phasic electrical activity before activation of the chest wall pump muscles would help preserve upper airway patency.  In contrast, we anticipated that the reversal of this pattern with delayed activation of upper airway inspiratory muscles would be associated with upper airway narrowing or collapse.  Therefore the timing and amplitude of midline transmandibular and costal margin moving time average (MTA) electromyogram (EMG) signals were analyzed from 58 apnea cycles in stage 2 sleep in six OSA patients.  In 86% of the postapnea breaths analyzed the upper airway MTA peak activity preceded the chest wall peak activity.  In 86% of the obstructed respiratory efforts the upper airway MTA peak activity followed the chest wall peak activity.  The onset of phasic electrical activity followed this same pattern.  During inspiratory efforts when phasic inspiratory EMG amplitude did not change from preapnea to apnea, the timing changes noted above occurred.  Even within breaths the relative timing of the upper airway and chest wall electrical activities was closely associated with changes in the pressure-flow relationship.  We conclude that the relative timing of inspiratory activity of the upper airway and chest wall inspiratory muscles fluctuates during sleep in OSA.",9
"An analysis of randomized trials evaluating the effect of cholesterol reduction on total mortality and coronary heart disease incidence.  The primary aim of this study was to estimate the relation between cholesterol reduction and total mortality and coronary heart disease (CHD) incidence.  Secondarily, the clinical issues of whether the efficacy of cholesterol lowering is dependent on the treatment modality, presence of CHD at baseline, or the simultaneous introduction of other interventions was explored.  All randomized clinical intervention trials of cholesterol reduction were used in an overview analysis of total mortality rate and CHD incidence; analysis was performed with weighted linear regression.  The trials include those that used primary and secondary intervention, diet and drugs, and single or multifactor design.  Nineteen trials were analyzed for total mortality, and of the 19, 16 were analyzed for CHD incidence rate.  Net difference in cholesterol change between study groups was used as the independent variable, and the three previously mentioned dichotomous design characteristics were used as additional independent variables.  For every 1% reduction in cholesterol, an estimated 2.5% reduction in CHD incidence is indicated (95% CL: 1.1, 3.9).  With regard to CHD drug trials tended toward better efficiency in cholesterol lowering than did dietary trials.  With regard to total mortality, this efficiency was higher in secondary than in primary preventive trials.  The efficiency was also somewhat dependent on the baseline cholesterol level.  This study shows that cholesterol reduction is effective in lowering CHD incidence, but cholesterol reduction must be at least 8-9% to be effective in lowering total mortality.",13
"Calcitropic hormones, platelet calcium, and blood pressure in essential hypertension.  Plasma ionized calcium, platelet cytosolic calcium (using the fura-2 method in gel-filtered platelets), parathyroid hormone (both the intact hormone and a midmolecule portion), calcitriol, and calcidiol were measured in 19 untreated male patients with essential hypertension and 19 age-matched normotensive male research subjects.  Mean levels of platelet cytosolic calcium, parathyroid hormone, calcitriol, and calcidiol were all significantly higher, whereas plasma ionized calcium was significantly lower, in the hypertensive group compared with the normotensive group.  Both platelet cytosolic calcium and intact parathyroid hormone were positively correlated with mean arterial pressure (r = 0.58, p less than 0.001; r = 0.54, p less than 0.001, respectively), whereas plasma ionized calcium was inversely correlated with mean arterial pressure (r = -0.60, p less than 0.001) in the combined group of all study subjects.  All three of these correlations were significant in the hypertensive group alone but not in the normotensive group alone.  When analyzed with plasma ionized calcium, body mass index, serum calcitriol, and calcidiol in a multivariable regression model, the significance of the partial regressions of platelet cytosolic calcium and parathyroid hormone with mean arterial pressure persisted.  Intact parathyroid hormone was positively correlated to platelet cytosolic calcium (r = 0.43, p less than 0.01) and plasma ionized calcium was inversely correlated to platelet cytosolic calcium (r = -0.44, p less than 0.01).  These results confirm previous reports of disturbances of calcium metabolism in essential hypertension and suggest that the elevated platelet cytosolic calcium observed in essential hypertension may be linked to one or more of these alterations of calcium metabolism.",13
"Biguanides and sulfonylureas as combination therapy in NIDDM.  Oral combination therapy with biguanides (metformin) and sulfonylureas is discussed.  The rationale for the use of this combination is based on the different sites of action of the two kinds of drugs and the possibility for obtaining additive or potentiating effects and reduced side effects.  The clinical usefulness of chlorpropamide and glyburide in combination with metformin has been demonstrated in some clinical trials.  The combination may provide satisfactory glycemic control for several years, and possibly insulin therapy can be postponed or even avoided.  No special safety problems are encountered with the use of the combination other than those attributed to the use of metformin or sulfonylurea alone, i.e., lactic acidosis and hypoglycemia, respectively.  The lethality risks of these associated conditions are comparable.  It is concluded that more data are needed to evaluate the full clinical potential and the mechanism of action of oral combination therapy.",17
"The prognostic significance of CA 125 half-life in patients with ovarian cancer who have received primary chemotherapy after surgical cytoreduction.  Fifty-four patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer were monitored with serial serum CA 125 levels after surgical cytoreduction and during multi-agent chemotherapy with cisplatin-containing regimens.  CA 125 half-life of less than 20 days was associated with prolonged overall survival (p less than 0.015).  In those patients who eventually were found to be disease-free at surgical surveillance procedures, normalization of serum CA 125 levels to less than 35 U/ml within 65 days of primary operation also suggested an improved survival (p less than 0.059).",3
"The inhibition of NK cell function by azathioprine during the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.  Treatment with azathioprine of patients with rheumatoid arthritis leads to a dramatic reduction in the 4 h NK cytotoxicity against K562 cells.  The 24 h cytotoxicity against K562 and U937 cells, however, remains intact.  The generation of cell-free supernatant cytotoxic factor(s) after incubating non-adherent mononuclear cells with U937 cells for 24 h is similar in the azathioprine patients and the controls.  A large part of this supernatant cytotoxicity is due to tumour necrosis factor alpha which can be inhibited by a specific monoclonal antibody.  The mechanism of the reduced 4 h NK cytotoxicity remains unknown but is probably not related to the anti-inflammatory properties of azathioprine.",16
"Time course of hemodynamic responses to sodium in elderly hypertensive patients.  Thirty-one patients with essential hypertension (81.6 +/- 6.9 years old) were studied during two different regimens of sodium intake: 120 meq/day for 8 weeks and 344 meq/day for 2 weeks.  Systemic hemodynamic data were measured with Doppler echocardiography from which the mitral flow velocity integral, cardiac index, and total peripheral resistance were calculated.  The salt-sensitive patients in whom the increase in total peripheral resistance was greater than the increase in cardiac index with salt loading were termed SST.  In the salt-sensitive patients termed SSC, the increase in cardiac index was greater than the increase in total peripheral resistance with increased sodium intake.  All SST patients on day 7 of the high sodium diet remained in the SST group on day 14.  Nine of 13 patients in the SSC group on day 7 remained in the SSC group on day 14, and the remaining four patients in the SSC group on day 7 fell into the SST group on day 14.  Four of eight non-salt-sensitive (NSS) patients on day 7 of the high salt regimen remained in the NSS group on day 14, whereas the remaining four patients in the NSS group on day 7 fell into the SSC group on day 14.  Our data suggest a changing pattern with sodium loading of initially high cardiac index followed by a persistently raised total peripheral resistance.  The celiac, superior mesenteric, and renal arteries vasoconstricted with sodium repletion in both SST and SSC patients.  With salt loading, the terminal aortic vascular bed vasodilated in the SSC patients and vasoconstricted in the SST patients.",13
"L-tyrosine potentiates the anorexia induced by mixed-acting sympathomimetic drugs in hyperphagic rats.  The effects of L-tyrosine (L-TYR) on the anorectic activity of several mixed-acting sympathomimetics were determined during the dark cycle in rats made hyperphagic by food deprivation.  L-TYR (200 mg/kg) significantly potentiated the anorectic activity of phenylpropanolamine, (-)-ephedrine and (+)-amphetamine by 48, 50 and 37%, respectively.  When the dose of L-TYR was varied (25-400 mg/kg), a significant dose-dependent relationship was noted.  The observed potentiation was positively correlated with increases in brain TYR concentrations; blockade of L-TYR uptake into the brain by the coadministration of L-valine prevented this potentiation.  Various other L-amino acids, as well as D-TYR, failed to mimic the potentiating action of L-TYR.  As determined by alpha-methyl-p-TYR pretreatment, the L-TYR-induced potentiation was dependent upon increased catecholamine synthesis.  Although various other mixed-acting sympathomimetic anorexiants were similarly potentiated by L-TYR, the direct-acting beta-2 adrenoceptor anorexiants, salbutamol and methoxyphenamine, were not.  These results indicate that L-TYR specifically potentiates the anorectic activity of the studied mixed-acting sympathomimetics and are consistent with the requirement of the central conversion of L-TYR to catecholamines via TYR hydroxylase for this response.  The possibility that the effect of mixed-acting sympathomimetics is normally limited by the availability of L-TYR is suggested.",22
"Prototype volume-controlled resuscitator for neonates and infants.  Twenty-five infants receiving assisted ventilation in an ICU were manually ventilated for 5-min periods using either a new prototype volume-controlled resuscitator (VCR) or a standard self-inflating resuscitator (SIR).  Variables monitored during these 5-min periods included heart rate, respiratory rate, mean arterial pressure, mean airway pressure (Paw), end-tidal CO2 (PetCO2), pulse oximetry oxygen saturation, PaO2, and PaCO2.  Significant differences in posttrial values for the following variables were: a) PetCO2 (31.2 +/- 9.1 vs.  25.6 +/- 8.2 torr, p less than .001); b) PaCO2 (38.0 +/- 4.9 vs.  33.2 +/- 6.7 torr, p less than .01); and c) pH (7.4 +/- 0.6 vs.  7.5 +/- 0.1, p less than .04) at comparable Paw (9.5 +/- 7.6 vs.  8.0 +/- 6.0, NS).  Eighty-four percent (21/25) of infants in the VCR group had normal PaCO2 values (35 to 45 torr) while only 44% (11/25) in the SIR group achieved normocarbia (p less than .001).  Measurements of the highest (Pmax) and lowest (Pmin) inspiratory pressure (cm H2O) in 15 patients demonstrated marked variation in Pmax with the SIR.  Differences in Pmax (SIR minus VCR) were significant (10.8 +/- 3.7, p less than .02) but not in Pmin (0.5 +/- 3.5, NS).  Our study demonstrates that ventilation with the VCR resulted in less hyperventilation with minimal pressure variability as compared with the SIR.  Further studies in the neonate are warranted.",7
"Effect of long-term treatment with an inhaled corticosteroid (budesonide) on airway hyperresponsiveness and clinical asthma in nonsteroid-dependent asthmatics.  Several short-term studies have shown that inhaled steroids can reduce airway hyper-responsiveness in asthma.  To evaluate whether prolonged treatment can bring about full recovery, this double-blind, randomized, controlled trial examined the effect of budesonide, 400 micrograms daily for 1 yr, on airway hyperresponsiveness.  The time course and characteristics of improvements and associated changes in clinical asthma severity were also evaluated.  Thirty-two stable adult asthmatics, requiring bronchodilators alone, were selected.  Before and monthly throughout the study, airway responsiveness to methacholine was measured and clinical asthma severity assessed by questionnaire, daily bronchodilator use, and number of asthma exacerbations.  Patients receiving budesonide showed a fourfold mean improvement in airway responsiveness compared with those receiving placebo (p less than 0.0005), whose responsiveness remained very stable.  Fifteen of the 16 budesonide subjects improved and 5 returned to the normal range.  Largest improvements occurred during the first 3 months but, in some, were still progressing slowly at 1 yr.  Improvements in responsiveness were accompanied by significant improvements in asthma symptoms, bronchodilator use, and number of asthma exacerbations.  The results show that regular, prolonged use of inhaled steroid can produce marked improvements in airway hyperresponsiveness, sometimes with full resolution, and these improvements are accompanied by clinically significant improvements in clinical asthma.",19
"The comparative efficacy and toxicity of second-line drugs in rheumatoid arthritis. Results of two metaanalyses.  We performed 2 metaanalyses of placebo-controlled and comparative clinical trials to examine the relative efficacy and toxicity of methotrexate (MTX), injectable gold, D-penicillamine (DP), sulfasalazine (SSZ), auranofin (AUR), and antimalarial drugs, the second-line drugs most commonly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  For the efficacy study, we applied a set of inclusion criteria and focused on trials which provided information on tender joint count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or grip strength.  We found 66 clinical trials that contained 117 treatment groups of interest, and for each drug, we combined the treatment groups.  For each outcome, results showed that AUR tended to be weaker than other second-line drugs.  The results of the 3 outcome measures were synthesized into a composite measure of outcomes, and AUR was significantly weaker than MTX (P = 0.006), injectable gold (P less than 0.0001), DP (P less than 0.0001), and SSZ (P = 0.009) and was slightly, but not significantly, weaker than antimalarial agents (P = 0.11).  We also found heterogeneity among antimalarial agents, in that patients treated with chloroquine did better than those treated with hydroxychloroquine.  We found little difference in efficacy between MTX, injectable gold, DP, and SSZ.  A power analysis showed that a trial should contain at least 170 patients per treatment group to successfully differentiate between more effective and less effective (e.g., AUR) second-line drugs.  None of the reported interdrug comparative trials we reviewed were this large.  For the toxicity study, our inclusion criteria captured RA trials which reported the proportion of patients who discontinued therapy because of drug toxicity and the total proportion who dropped out.  We found 71 clinical trials that contained 129 treatment groups.  The average proportion who dropped out and the average proportion who dropped out because of drug toxicity were computed for each drug.  Overall, 30.2% of the patients in these trials dropped out; 50% of them did so because of drug toxicity.  Injectable gold had higher toxicity rates (P less than 0.05) and higher total dropout rates (P less than 0.01) than any other drug; 30% of gold-treated patients dropped out because of side effects versus 15% of all trial patients.  Antimalarial drugs and AUR had relatively low rates of toxicity; the rate for MTX was imprecise because of discrepancies between trials.  Thus, of the commonly used second-line drugs, AUR is the weakest, and injectable gold is the most toxic.  Agents introduced in the future will be compared with these drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).",16
"Simultaneous transesophageal atrial pacing and transesophageal two-dimensional echocardiography: a new method of stress echocardiography   The diagnostic use of exercise echocardiography has been widely reported.  However, transthoracic exercise echocardiography is inadequate in up to 20% of patients because of poor image quality related to exercise.  In an attempt to overcome these limitations, a system was developed in which transesophageal echocardiography is combined with simultaneous transesophageal atrial pacing by means of the same probe.  In a prospective study, transesophageal echocardiography was performed before, during and immediately after maximal atrial pacing in 50 patients with suspected coronary artery disease.  Results of transesophageal stress echocardiography were considered abnormal when new pacing-induced regional wall motion abnormalities were observed.  Correlative routine bicycle exercise testing was carried out in 44 patients.  Cardiac catheterization was performed in all patients.  The success rate in obtaining high quality diagnostic images was 100% by transesophageal echocardiography.  All nine patients without angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease had a normal result on the transesophageal stress echocardiogram (100% specificity).  Thirty-eight of 41 patients with coronary artery disease (defined as greater than or equal to 50% luminal diameter narrowing of at least one major vessel) had an abnormal result on the transesophageal stress echocardiogram (93% sensitivity).  The sensitivity of the technique for one, two or three vessel disease was 85%, 100% and 100%, respectively, compared with 44%, 50% and 83%, respectively, for bicycle exercise testing; the 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) during rapid atrial pacing showed a sensitivity of 25%, 64% and 86%, respectively.  Thus, rapid atrial pacing combined with simultaneous transesophageal echocardiography is a highly specific and sensitive technique for the detection of coronary artery disease.  Ischemia-induced wall motion abnormalities were detected earlier than observed ECG changes.  The technique appears to be particularly suited to patients who are unable to perform an active stress test or those with poor quality transthoracic echocardiograms.",13
Denatured muscle grafts for nerve repair. An experimental model of nerve damage in leprosy   About 20% of patients with leprosy develop localised granulomatous lesions in peripheral nerves.  We report experiments in guinea-pigs in which freeze-thawed autogenous muscle grafts were used for the treatment of such mycobacterial granulomas.  Granulomas were induced in guinea-pig tibial nerves and the animals were left for 7 to 100 days in order to assess maximal damage.  The local area of nerve damage was then excised and the gap filled with denatured muscle grafts.  Clinical assessment after periods up to 150 days showed good sensory and motor recovery which correlated well with the histological findings.  The muscle graft technique may be of value for the treatment of chronic nerve lesions in selected cases of leprosy.,0
"Subzonal insemination for the alleviation of infertility.  Methods were developed to facilitate the use of subzonal insemination to achieve fertilization in vitro.  A clinical trial was undertaken in those patients having previously failed to achieve fertilization by in vitro fertilization, and in those presenting with severe oligospermia/oligoasthenospermia.  From 85 patients, 585 oocytes were obtained.  Of these, 0.3% had been ""activated"" parthenogenetically in vivo, 369 (72%) at metaphase II underwent subzonal insemination, 15% were fertilized, and 0.5% had three pronuclei.  Thirty-eight percent of the patients had fertilization with 36% having a replacement.  One conceptus was replaced in 19 patients, two conceptus in 8 patients, and three in 4 patients.  A twin and two singleton pregnancies were established.",12
"Corpus luteum function in early pregnancies is primarily determined by the rate of change of human chorionic gonadotropin levels.  Regulation of human corpus luteum activity was studied with radioimmunoassays and bioassays of sera drawn serially from women suspected of having ectopic pregnancies.  Progesterone values exhibited considerable overlap in pregnancies that were subsequently classified as normal intrauterine (n = 21), ectopic (n = 35), or spontaneous abortion (n = 14).  The rate of change of human chorionic gonadotropin concentration was significantly correlated with progesterone levels in ectopic (r = 0.64) and all pregnancies (r = 0.70).  There was no correlation (r = -0.18) between the rate of change of human chorionic gonadotropin and the bioactivity produced per volume of serum.  Ectopic pregnancies and normal intrauterine pregnancies did not differ in their ratio of in vivo bioactivity to immunoactivity.  From these data we conclude that corpus luteum activity is primarily regulated by the rate of change of human chorionic gonadotropin concentration, without the involvement of other serum factors.  We also conclude that reduced corpus luteum function in ectopic pregnancies is not a result of biochemical modification of the human chorionic gonadotropin molecule.  Finally, we discourage the use of single progesterone values in screening for ectopic pregnancies because of the considerable overlap in progesterone values among these and normal intrauterine pregnancies.",12
"Retroviral recombination and reverse transcription.  Recombination occurs at a high rate in retroviral replication, and its observation requires a virion containing two different RNA molecules (heterodimeric particles).  Analysis of retroviral recombinants formed after a single round of replication revealed that (i) the nonselected markers changed more frequently than expected from the rate of recombination of selected markers; (ii) the transfer of the initially synthesized minus strand strong stop DNA was either intramolecular or intermolecular; (iii) the transfer of the first synthesized plus strand strong stop DNA was always intramolecular; and (iv) there was a strong correlation between the type of transfer of the minus strand strong stop DNA and the number of template switches observed.  These data suggest that retroviral recombination is ordered and occurs during the synthesis of both minus and plus strand DNA.",3
"Acute changes in the dynamics of the cerebrospinal fluid system during experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Early changes in intracranial pressure (ICP), ICP volume index, and resistance to absorption of cerebrospinal fluid induced by experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage were studied in cats.  After SAH, the ICP was slightly elevated, and there was a decrease in the buffering capacity of the intracranial space and a sharp rise in outflow resistance.  During infusion of blood into the cisterna magna with a constant infusion rate, an extensive increase in ICP could be demonstrated in contrast to the infusion of saline, which caused only slight elevation of ICP.  Furthermore, during blood infusion, the ICP level did not reach a plateau phase of pressure, as was demonstrated during infusion of saline.  It is suggested that the marked increase in ICP during blood infusion into the subarachnoid space is caused by intracranial volume loading and the simultaneous increase in cerebrospinal fluid outflow resistance.  It is concluded that the reported relationship between increased cerebrospinal fluid outflow resistance and increased ICP supports the hypothesis of a strong increase in ICP during subarachnoid hemorrhage in human subjects.",13
Embolization of a giant renal arterial aneurysm.  A 49-year-old man presented with right flank pain.  Angiography revealed a giant right renal arterial aneurysm.  Giant renal arterial aneurysms are typically treated by nephrectomy.  In this patient the aneurysm was embolized successfully with multiple Gianturco-Wallace coils and polyvinyl alcohol.  This case indicates that embolization may be a reasonable alternative to nephrectomy.,13
"Iron chelation by deferoxamine inhibits lipid peroxidation during cardiopulmonary bypass in humans.  Iron catalysis is involved in oxygen-derived free radical generation and subsequent lipid peroxidation, which have been reported to occur during cardiopulmonary bypass in humans.  We assessed the effects of the iron chelator deferoxamine on the susceptibility of circulating low density lipoproteins (LDLs) to induced peroxidation in 20 adult patients (10 controls and 10 treated) undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass for coronary or valve procedures.  Deferoxamine was given both intravenously (30 mg/kg body wt, starting 30 minutes before bypass and extending for the next 4 hours) and as an additive to the cardioplegic solution (250 mg/l).  Blood samples were taken from both atria before and immediately after the end of cardiopulmonary bypass.  Plasma lipid peroxidation was assessed by measuring spectrophotometrically the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) content of selectively isolated LDLs after their exposure to a peroxidizing agent.  Before cardiopulmonary bypass, the right and left atrial blood values of LDL-TBARS were not significantly different between the two groups.  Cardiopulmonary bypass resulted in a lipid peroxidation of significantly greater magnitude in control than in treated patients.  Postbypass right atrial values for LDL-TBARS (expressed in mumol/mmol LDL-phospholipids) were 45.7 +/- 17.2 (mean +/- SEM) in control patients and 6.9 +/- 2.9 in treated patients (p less than 0.02), whereas in the left atrial blood, LDL-TBARS yielded values of 62.7 +/- 20.5 and 10.3 +/- 3.9, respectively (p less than 0.01).",22
"The familial occurrence of bullous mastocytosis (diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis).  We studied four patients (a mother, her two daughters, and her son) with bullous mastocytosis, or diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis, whose genetic inheritance suggested an autosomal dominant pattern.  The clinical characteristics included extensive bullae, numerous urticaria, pruritus, flushing, and pseudolichenified skin over all body surfaces without systemic organ involvement.  The histopathologic findings disclosed a pronounced accumulation of mast cells in the dermis.  Electron microscopic studies of lesional skin obtained in infancy showed round or spindle-shaped mast cells with numerous fingerlike villous protrusions.  The cytoplasmic granules varied in size and shape, and the appearance of degranulation was markedly noted.  In the adult, most mast cells had markedly decreased numbers of granules and cytoplasmic villi.  Some cells displayed degenerative or necrotic appearances.  These findings correlated well with the clinical course of these cases, which improved spontaneously over time.",16
"Anaphylaxis following ingestion of a psyllium-containing cereal.  Recently, psyllium hydrophilic mucilloid, a bulk-forming laxative, has been added to breakfast cereals for cholesterol-lowering effects.  We report a case of a 60-year-old woman with no prior history of psyllium ingestion who developed anaphylactic symptoms after eating a psyllium-containing cereal.  Her only previous exposure was dispensing a psyllium-containing laxative as a nurse.  Immunoglobulin E-mediated sensitization was documented by skin testing and basophil histamine release.  The literature is reviewed regarding allergic reactions to psyllium.  Health care workers and pharmaceutical workers handling psyllium may be at increased risk due to sensitization from inhalation.  Physicians and consumers should be aware of potential serious reactions from eating psyllium-containing cereals even without prior history of ingestion of psyllium.",19
"Extended neck dissection.  From the time Crile described radical neck dissection in 1906, this surgical procedure became popular in the management of metastatic cancer in the neck.  Over the past two decades, the modified neck dissection has been effectively utilized for conservation of function and cosmesis while achieving the same oncologic goals.  However, there are several instances where the above standard procedures are not adequate for resection of malignant tumors.  Although there is a definite trend toward conservation procedures, extended neck dissection is often necessary especially in patients with N2 and N3 disease.  Apart from the standard structures removed in radical neck dissection, the other structures removed in extended neck dissection include skin, the digastric muscle, hypoglossal nerve, vagus nerve, sympathetic chain, ramus mandibularis, carotid artery, tracheo-esophageal nodes, etc.  Over the past seven years, we have performed 40 extended neck dissections.  All the patients had N2 or N3 disease in the neck.  Nine patients had unknown primaries.  Thirteen patients had their primary tumors in the oral cavity and 11 in the laryngopharynx.  Five patients had primary tumor in the salivary glands and two patients had metastatic melanoma.  Patients who underwent extensive skin excision had pectoralis myocutaneous flap reconstruction.  All patients received postoperative radiation therapy.  One patient died of cardiac problems 4 weeks after operation.  Local control was achieved in 70%.  The most difficult region for local control was the disease behind the mastoid process, and the most difficult problems were patients with involvement of the subdermal lymphatics.  Our data suggests that there are definite situations where extended neck dissection is indicated with satisfactory local control of the nodal disease.",3
"Antidepressant pharmacotherapy of depression associated with multiple sclerosis.  In a double-blind clinical trial involving 28 patients with multiple sclerosis and major depressive disorder, 14 patients were randomly assigned to a 5-week trial of desipramine and individual psychotherapy and 14 to placebo plus psychotherapy.  Clinical judgments indicated that patients treated with desipramine improved significantly more than the placebo group.  This was confirmed by scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression but not by Beck Depression Inventory scores.  Side effects limited desipramine dosage in half of the treated patients.  The authors conclude that desipramine has a modest beneficial effect in serious depression associated with multiple sclerosis but that side effects may be more of a limiting factor than in patients without medical or neurologic disease.",19
"Persistence of mucosal gastric carcinomas for 8 and 6 years in two patients.  A small gastric carcinoma was detected in a man, but he refused surgery.  Eight years later, he was readmitted for a check-up, and a partial gastrectomy was performed.  Pathologic examination revealed a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma restricted within the mucosa.  In another man, an irregularly shaped, grossly depressed lesion indicating a malignancy was present at the gastric angle, and 6 years later he agreed to a partial gastrectomy.  The lesion proved to be a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma confined to the mucosa.  Retrospective examination of the original biopsy specimen revealed a small area of adenocarcinoma, presumably overlooked at the initial examination.  Thus, some gastric carcinomas of the well-differentiated type can grow at an extremely slow rate, without extensive spread or invasion.  Findings in these cases contribute to knowledge of the biological behavior of gastric carcinomas.",3
"Effect of tachycardia on regional function and transmural myocardial perfusion during graded coronary pressure reduction in conscious dogs   The purpose of the present study was to examine subendocardial flow and function during graded coronary pressure reduction to determine the effect of tachycardia on the lower autoregulatory pressure limit (critical coronary pressure) in unanesthetized dogs.  During atrial pacing at a rate of 200 beats/min, subendocardial flow measured by radioactive microspheres averaged 1.55 +/- 0.34 ml/min/g and remained unchanged as pressure was reduced over the autoregulatory plateau from 84 +/- 10 to 59 +/- 7 mm Hg.  Further reductions in coronary pressure to below a critical coronary pressure of approximately 60 mm Hg were associated with concomitant reductions in subendocardial flow and the endocardial-epicardial flow ratio during tachycardia.  Although regional function remained constant over the autoregulatory plateau, there was a rightward shift of the coronary pressure-function relation during ischemia in response to a steady-state increase in rate from 100 to 200 beats/min.  Reductions in regional wall thickening began when coronary pressures reached 38 +/- 7 mm Hg at a heart rate of 100 beats/min and 61 +/- 6 mm Hg at a heart rate of 200 beats/min (p less than 0.005).  Similar critical coronary pressure values were obtained for subendocardial segment shortening.  Relations between subendocardial flow and myocardial function measured by both transmural wall thickening and subendocardial segment shortening were linear during pacing at a heart rate of 200 beats/min with relative reductions in wall thickening related to reductions in subendocardial flow on a nearly one-to-one basis.  The results of this study demonstrate that there is a shift in the lower limit of subendocardial autoregulation during tachycardia as manifest by the onset of subendocardial ischemia at a higher distal coronary artery pressure.  The shift in critical coronary pressure relates to an increase in resting flow requirements due to increased demand and diminished subendocardial vasodilator reserve at any given coronary pressure secondary to a reduction in the time available for diastolic subendocardial perfusion during tachycardia.",13
"Computer-assisted tomography of scoliosis operated with or without Harrington's rod. Biomechanics aspects of the fusion.  Forty-eight cases of posterior vertebral arthrodesis for scoliosis, performed with or without instrumentation, were examined using computed tomography (CT) scanning to study the evolving fusion mass.  The authors observed that the fusion mass area is more voluminous in the cases performed without instrumentation than in the ones performed with instrumentation, and that 2 years after fusion the bone mass shows already a considerable increase.  For the cases operated with Harrington's technique, the increase of the fusion mass is very slow and becomes considerable 5 years after operation.  In both series, the section of the fusion masses at the apex of the curve is asymmetric (with prevalence on the concave side), with an area of central resorption that shows the structure of a long bone (box section).",4
Semantic deterioration in Alzheimer's: the patterns to expect.  Differentiating language changes between the normal aged and those in the early stages of dementia is never simple.  Knowing the differences and what to expect can aid in making this diagnosis.,9
"Intracoronary urokinase for intracoronary thrombus accumulation complicating percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in acute ischemic syndromes.  Intracoronary urokinase was used to treat flow-limiting intracoronary thrombus accumulation that complicated successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) during acute ischemic syndromes in 48 patients who were followed up through the acute phase of their illness.  The study group comprised 10 patients with unstable angina pectoris, 18 patients with an evolving acute myocardial infarction, and 20 patients with postinfarction angina.  The initial mean percent coronary diameter stenosis for the entire population was 95 +/- 7% and decreased with initial PTCA to 41 +/- 20% (p less than 0.001), with improved corresponding coronary flow by Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction trial (TIMI) grade.  However, thrombus accumulation then resulted in a significant increase in percent diameter stenosis to 83 +/- 17% (p less than 0.001); a corresponding significant reduction in coronary flow also occurred by TIMI grade.  After administration of intracoronary urokinase (mean dose, 141,000 units; range, 100,000-250,000 units during an average period of 34 minutes), with additional PTCA, mean percent diameter stenosis significantly decreased to 34 +/- 17% (p less than 0.001); a correspondingly significant improvement in mean coronary flow by TIMI grade occurred to 2.9 +/- 0.2.  Overall, the angiographic success rate was 90%.  There were no ischemic events requiring repeat PTCA and no procedure-related myocardial infarctions or deaths before hospital discharge.  One patient was referred for urgent coronary artery bypass graft surgery after a successful PTCA.  Plasma fibrinogen levels were obtained in 15 patients, and in no patient was the level below normal for our laboratory.",13
"Muscle blood flow and muscle metabolism during exercise and heat stress.  The effect of heat stress on blood flow and metabolism in an exercising leg was studied in seven subjects walking uphill (12-17%) at 5 km/h on a treadmill for 90 min or until exhaustion.  The first 30 min of exercise were performed in a cool environment (18-21 degrees C); then subjects moved to an adjacent room at 40 degrees C and continued to exercise at the same speed and inclination for a further 60 min or to exhaustion, whichever occurred first.  The rate of O2 consumption, 2.6 l/min (1.8-3.3) (average from cool and hot conditions), corresponded to 55-77% of their individual maximums.  In the cool environment a steady state was reached at 30 min.  When the subjects were shifted to the hot room, the core temperature and heart rate started to rise and reached values greater than 39 degrees C and near-maximal values, respectively, at the termination of the exercise.  The leg blood flow (thermodilution method), femoral arteriovenous O2 difference, and consequently leg O2 consumption were unchanged in the hot compared with the cool condition.  There was no increase in release of lactate and no reduction in glucose and free net fatty acid uptake in the exercising leg in the heat.  Furthermore, the rate of glycogen utilization in the gastrocnemius muscle was not elevated in the hot environment.  There was a tendency for cardiac output to increase in the heat (mean 15.2 to 18.4 l/min), which may have contributed to the increase in skin circulation, together with a possible further reduction in flow to other vascular beds, because muscle blood flow was not reduced.",22
"Alcoholic liver disease.  Alcoholic liver disease presents a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from mild asymptomatic fatty liver to alcoholic hepatitis and severe life-threatening liver failure with ascites, hemorrhaging esophageal varices, and encephalopathy.  Although still poorly understood, the mechanism of this injury is probably the result of numerous direct toxic and metabolic effects of alcohol on the hepatocyte.  Therapy consists primarily of abstinence and supportive care.  However, several newer treatments are actively being studied.  These include prednisolone, anabolic steroids, glucagon and insulin, propylthiouracil, and cyanidanol.  Colchicine is promising as an agent to inhibit fibrosis.  Complications of cirrhosis, including ascites and variceal hemorrhage, are the result of end stage disease.  A return to old techniques of ascitic fluid management suggests that therapeutic large-volume paracentesis with albumin infusion is a safe and effective form of therapy.  Variceal hemorrhage is best treated with sclerotherapy, vasoconstrictors, and balloon tamponade.  Little has been done to alter the ultimately dismal prognosis and long-term survival of alcoholic liver disease.",5
"Use of the pudendo-anal reflex in the treatment of neurogenic faecal incontinence.  An electrical stimulator has been devised to treat neurogenic faecal incontinence caused by pudendal nerve neuropathy and works on the basis of repeated stimulation of the pudendo-anal reflex arc.  Although conduction in the pudendo-anal reflex arc may be prolonged, and is so in neurogenic faecal incontinence, it must be shown to be present before the method can be used.  This stimulation results in an immediate rise in the pressure in the anal canal and a significant increase in the electromyographic activity of the external anal sphincter.  Maintenance of the stimulus over a two month period raised the mean resting pressure significantly in the anal canal and increased the reflex and voluntary responses of the external anal sphincter to coughing and squeezing actions respectively.  The length of the sphincter was not affected.  There was widening of the mean motor unit potential duration, though this was not significant.  The resting electromyogram was enhanced after the course of treatment, indicating greater spontaneous activity in the external sphincter.  The changes led to seven of the eight patients studied becoming continent at the end of the treatment.",5
"Response of Bitot's spots in preschool children to vitamin A treatment.  In a double-masked, placebo-controlled, clinical trial in Indonesia, 88 preschool children between the ages of 36 and 72 months with Bitot's spots were randomly assigned to 200,000 IU of oral vitamin A or placebo and followed up for five weeks.  Baseline and follow-up serum vitamin A levels were obtained.  Of the 45 children receiving vitamin A, 33 (73.3%) showed complete cure and disappearance of Bitot's spots, six (13.3%) had disappearance of some but not all Bitot's spots, and six (13.3%) were unresponsive to treatment.  The nonresponsive children were older, all male, and had higher initial mean serum vitamin A levels, 23.0 micrograms/dl, compared to 15.9 micrograms/dl in the cured group (P = .017).  These data suggest that normal vitamin A status may be found in approximately 13% of children with Bitot's spots before vitamin A intervention and that one fourth of those who had Bitot's spots originally will not be cured of all Bitot's spots after intervention.  These are important factors to consider when using Bitot's spots in prevalence surveys as a clinical sign of vitamin A deficiency.",22
"Beneficial effect of 1,3-butanediol on cerebral energy metabolism and edema following brain embolization in rats.  We assessed the effect of 1,3-butanediol on cerebral energy metabolism and edema after inducing multifocal brain infarcts in 108 rats by the intracarotid injection of 50-microns carbonized microspheres.  An ethanol dimer that induces systemic ketosis, 25 mmol/kg i.p.  butanediol was injected every 3 hours to produce a sustained increase in the plasma level of beta-hydroxybutyrate.  Treatment significantly attenuated ischemia-induced metabolic changes by increasing the concentrations of phosphocreatine, adenosine triphosphate, and glycogen and by reducing the concentrations of pyruvate and lactate.  Lactate concentration 2, 6, and 12 hours after embolization decreased by 13%, 44%, and 46%, respectively.  Brain water content increased from 78.63% in six unembolized rats to 80.93% in 12 saline-treated and 79.57% in seven butanediol-treated rats 12 hours after embolization.  (p less than 0.05).  The decrease in water content was associated with significant decreases in the concentrations of sodium and chloride.  The antiedema effect of butanediol could not be explained by an osmotic mechanism since equimolar doses of urea or ethanol were ineffective.  Our results support the hypothesis that the beneficial effect of butanediol is mediated through cerebral utilization of ketone bodies arising from butanediol metabolism, reducing the rate of glycolysis and the deleterious accumulation of lactic acid during ischemia.",9
Enhanced expression of c-myc and H-ras oncogenes in Letterer-Siwe disease. A sequential study using colorimetric in situ hybridization.  Tissues from two patients with disseminated histiocytosis X (Letterer-Siwe disease) in which histiocytosis X cells exhibited histologic and cytologic features of malignancy were evaluated by in situ hybridization with the use of biotinylated nucleic acid probes to c-myc and H-ras oncogenes.  Enhanced expression of these oncogenes was observed in mononucleated and multinucleated cells of histiocytosis X in the terminal proliferative phase but not in the early quiescent phase of Letterer-Siwe disease in both patients.  Our findings indicate that deregulation of c-myc and H-ras in histiocytosis X are late events that likely confer a selective growth advantage to histiocytosis X cells.,3
"Chloroprocaine antagonism of epidural opioid analgesia: a receptor-specific phenomenon?  Sixty healthy patients scheduled for elective cesarean delivery under epidural anesthesia were randomized to receive either lidocaine or 2-chloroprocaine as the primary local anesthetic agent.  When patients first complained of postoperative pain in the recovery room, they were given either fentanyl 50 micrograms or butorphanol 2 mg, epidurally, in a randomized, blinded fashion.  Postoperative analgesia, quantitated on a visual analogue scale, as well as time elapsed until first request for supplemental opioid, did not differ for patients receiving butorphanol after either 2-chloroprocaine or lidocaine anesthesia.  In contrast, epidural fentanyl produced a shorter and lesser degree of sensory analgesia after 2-chloroprocaine use, whereas epidural fentanyl after lidocaine anesthesia provided pain relief similar to that seen in the butorphanol groups.  Side effects were limited to somnolence with butorphanol and pruritus with fentanyl.  No evidence of respiratory depression was seen in any patient.  We conclude that 2 mg of butorphanol epidurally provides approximately 2 to 3 h of effective analgesia after cesarean delivery with either lidocaine or 2-chloroprocaine anesthesia.  Epidural fentanyl seems to be antagonized when 2-chloroprocaine, but not lidocaine, is used as the primary local anesthetic agent.  We suggest a possible mu-receptor-specific etiology for this effect.",22
"Intraamniotic infection in the very early phase of the second trimester.  A total of 157 consecutive patients were studied in an effort to examine prospectively the incidence of asymptomatic intraamniotic infection in the early phase of the second trimester.  All patients were referred for amniotic fluid karyotyping.  In addition, the amniotic fluids were examined for Gram stain and were directly cultured on blood agar and MacConkey agar as well as in thioglycollate broth.  We found positive amniotic fluid cultures in eight cases (5.09%); however, results of Gram stain examinations were negative in all amniotic fluid samples.  The data indicate that there is no correlation between white blood cells in the amniotic fluid and positive amniotic fluid culture results.  Only one pregnancy with positive amniotic fluid culture resulted in a septic abortion.  Therefore we can suggest that intraamniotic infection can exist early in pregnancy, even with intact membranes, and in most cases without any clinical symptoms.",0
"Effect of vitamin C on histamine bronchial responsiveness of patients with allergic rhinitis.  The effect of acute oral administration of 2 g vitamin C on bronchial responsiveness to inhaled histamine in 16 patients with allergic rhinitis was compared with placebo on two consecutive days in a double-blind, crossover design.  The PC15FEV1 was significantly increased one hour after treatment with vitamin C but not after placebo.",8
"Subxiphoid pericardiotomy versus echocardiography: a prospective evaluation of the diagnosis of occult penetrating cardiac injury.  Diagnostic subxiphoid pericardiotomy (SP) is presently advocated for the diagnosis of occult cardiac injuries in patients with stable vital signs with juxta-cardiac-penetrating chest wounds.  This approach, however, results in a reported 80% negative pericardial exploration rate.  To investigate the reliability of bedside two-dimension echocardiography (2-D echo) in predicting cardiac injury as compared to SP, a prospective study was undertaken of patients with stable vital signs who were admitted with penetrating chest wounds that were located within the space bounded by the manubrium, nipples, and subcostal line.  Initial evaluation of the patients with bedside 2-D echo was found to have a 96% accuracy, 97% specificity, and 90% sensitivity in predicting cardiac injury.  The only false-negative findings were in a patient who consented to SP 18 hours after bedside 2-D echo was performed.  The reliability of bedside 2-D echo compared to SP was not significantly different according to the kappa measure of reliability.  These data suggest that bedside 2-D echo is an expeditious and reliable method to diagnose occult cardiac injuries during the initial assessment of a patient with stable vital signs who had penetrating chest trauma.  This approach may allow for the selective use of SP on patients with positive bedside 2-D echo and could eliminate unnecessary surgical procedures.",20
"Effects of heparin versus saline solution on intermittent infusion device irrigation.  The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of 1 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride with 10 units of heparin in 1 ml sodium chloride solution, both containing benzyl alcohol, in maintaining patency and reducing the incidence of phlebitis in patients with intermittent infusion devices.  The subjects (N = 32) were randomly assigned in a double-blind experimental design.  Repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed no significant difference between the groups in phlebitis or patency variables.  The results from this controlled study would suggest that 0.9% sodium chloride is as effective as 10 units of heparin in sodium chloride solution in maintaining intermittent infusion device patency and preventing phlebitis.",13
"Laboratory tests in the follow-up of treated alcoholics: how often should testing be repeated?  The study group consisted of 60 male and 13 female alcohol-dependent employed patients who participated in inpatient treatment for alcoholism.  They were followed up bimonthly for eight months after the treatment period.  The results with GGT, ASAT, ALAT, MCV and the combination of GGT and MCV were studied with respect to the effect of taking the tests once (at eight months), twice (once every four months) or four times (bimonthly).  According to our definition, the treatment outcome was good when the laboratory test values were within the normal range during the whole follow-up period.  The differences in observed outcome (at eight months after treatment) were small whether one took the tests once at the end of the follow-up period or up to four (i.e.  bimonthly) times.  Nevertheless, there were some differences between the laboratory markers.  To get the most accurate picture of drinking during the follow-up period one should repeat the test bimonthly with ASAT or ALAT, once every four months with GGT (or combined GGT and MCV), and once after eight months with MCV.  When the time course of relapses is important for the study the more frequent test taking is also indicated.",20
"Deleterious effects of testicular venous occlusion in young rats.  To determine the differences between testicular arterial and venous obstruction, the spermatic artery or vein, or both, were occluded for varying periods of time in young rats.  Two months later, at the conclusion of the study, the testes were examined.  Histologic degeneration after vascular obstruction was graded by a modified Johnsen's tubular biopsy score (TBS).  The testicular concentrations of enzymes (lactic dehydrogenase and sorbitol dehydrogenase), known to decrease with testicular injury, were measured.  TBS and seminiferous tubule diameter (STD) were found to decrease significantly after two hours of vascular occlusion and were similar regardless of whether the obstruction was produced by occlusion of arterial inflow or venous drainage, or both.  Testicular concentration of enzymes decreased significantly after permanent ligation of the spermatic artery and vein, but decreased minimally when the vascular obstruction lasted less than 120 minutes.  Testicular injury produced by venous occlusion was equally severe and occurred as rapidly as injury produced by arterial or combined arteriovenous occlusion.  No significant injury was noted in the contralateral testes in any group.",13
"Physical features of Prader-Willi syndrome in neonates.  A retrospective study of 16 patients was undertaken to identify physical features that may typify neonates with Prader-Willi syndrome.  Several features known to be typical of Prader-Willi syndrome in early infancy were confirmed, including hypotonia and genital hypoplasia.  A number of features that have not previously been emphasized as characterizing Prader-Willi syndrome were also identified, most notably abnormal cry and, in males, signs of genital hypoplasia but with an apparently normal phallus.  Other features included disproportionately large head circumference, disproportionately large anterior fontanelle, mild micrognathia, mild anomalies of the gingivae or alveolar ridges, and changes in the appearance of the skin.  Appreciation of these features may assist the pediatrician in recognizing the child with Prader-Willi syndrome during the neonatal period, before the appearance of better-known findings of later onset, such as obesity and acromicria.",9
"Treatment of chromoblastomycosis.  Treatment of chromoblastomycosis is frequently difficult and unsatisfactory.  A representative case is presented of this chronic subcutaneous fungal infection, characterized by warty, cauliflower-like lesions usually on the extremities.  Chromoblastomycosis and its treatment are reviewed, with attention to itraconazole, a new triazole compound, as the possible drug of choice.",16
"Hyperemesis gravidarum as conversion disorder.  Psychosocial factors have long been believed to be important in the pathogenesis of emesis gravidarum (morning sickness) and hyperemesis gravidarum (HG).  Although this has been confirmed during extensive studies over the last 30 years, HG has never been described as a conversion reaction.  We describe two women presenting with hyperemesis who clearly fulfill diagnostic criteria for conversion.  We suggest that strong psychodynamic conflicts are expressed by this potentially dangerous symptom in a subset of individuals and that dynamic interventions have a role in treating certain patients with HG.",12
"Transient hyperprolactinemia is associated with a midcycle luteinizing hormone surge.  This study demonstrates that LH surge cycles in IVF patients were associated with significantly higher serum PRL concentrations than cycles in which a spontaneous LH surge did not occur.  Our findings support the hypothesis of concomitant LH and PRL release at the time of the midcycle gonadotropin surge, as well as that of estrogen sensitization of pituitary lactotropes, and suggest a possible mechanism for transient midcycle hyperprolactinemia.",9
"Response of angiographically normal and atherosclerotic left anterior descending coronary arteries to acetylcholine.  Acetylcholine-induced constriction of human coronary arteries in vivo is commonly attributed to endothelial dysfunction.  To examine the effects of 2 other important determinants of vascular responses--namely, agonist concentration and the segment of circulation under study--the diameters of proximal, middle and distal segments of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and coronary sinus oxygen saturation were measured in 10 patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries (group 1) and in 7 patients with coronary atherosclerosis (group 2) after intracoronary acetylcholine was infused at concentrations from 10(-7)M to between 10(-4)M and 10(-2)M.  In group 1, acetylcholine caused minor (less than or equal to 6%) but progressive dilatation of the LAD up to 10(-4)M, but constriction, particularly of the distal segments and tertiary branches, occurred at higher concentrations.  Over the same concentration range, coronary sinus oxygen saturation rose progressively from a basal level of 36 +/- 3% to a maximum of 72 +/- 3% in the absence of changes in heart rate and blood pressure, suggesting marked progressive dilatation of resistance vessels.  Concentrations greater than or equal to 10(-3)M caused intense constriction of distal epicardial vessels and, in some cases, anginal pain and objective signs of ischemia.  Conversely, in group 2, acetylcholine (infused only up to 10(-4)M for ethical reasons) failed to cause significant changes in LAD diameter.  These data suggest that the local acetylcholine concentration and coronary vascular segment under study may determine the observed response to at least an equivalent extent as does the presence or absence of coronary atherosclerosis, raising the question of whether a constrictor response to intracoronary acetylcholine reliably indicates the presence of coronary atherosclerosis.",13
"An efficient method for removing bilirubin.  Bilirubin is tightly bound to albumin, making hemoperfusion an ineffective treatment for hyperbilirubinemia.  By adding a safe unbinding agent to the blood (solutizer), which itself is adsorbed, hemoperfusion can become efficient and practical.  Canines were made hyperbilirubinemic with an intravenous infusion of a 5 mg/ml solution (with Na2CO3) for 1 hour.  Peak concentrations of 14-22 mg/dl were reached in adult dogs (25-35 kg).  Hemoperfusion was then initiated with or without (control) the solutizer (sodium benzoate).  The bilirubin unbinding effect of sodium benzoate was rapid and effective.  Because of the simultaneous adsorption of sodium benzoate, a small activated carbon section that was presaturated with the solutizer was located proximal to the main hemoperfusion column, in addition to continuous infusion to reach 20 mM in the blood.  Comparison of the normalized bilirubin concentration for benzoate augmented hemoperfusion with the average for control dogs, shows that benzoate results in a threefold decrease in the normalized bilirubin concentration after 1.5 hr of hemoperfusion.  Sodium benzoate may also have the advantage of protecting platelets during hemoperfusion.",17
"Aortic occlusion and vascular isolation allowing avascular hepatic resection.  Occlusion of the supraceliac abdominal aorta and hepatic vascular isolation were employed in a series of 15 patients as a definitive method to allow avascular hepatic resection.  The series was compared with an earlier group of patients treated conventionally.  In the avascular hepatic resection group there was no mortality; hypotension did not occur at the time of hepatic vascular isolation; rapid, accurate excision of the hepatic lesions could be achieved in a bloodless field; resection of midline lesions and those involving the great veins was possible; and ""segmentectomies,"" or resections crossing segmental boundaries, could be performed where previously formal hepatic lobectomies were required.  Concomitantly, the greatest amount of uninvolved hepatic parenchyma remained in situ.  There was increased ease of operative management, reduced blood loss, and reduced operating time (mean, 2.8 hours).",22
"Immunization of owl monkeys with a combination of Plasmodium falciparum asexual blood-stage synthetic peptide antigens.  A mixture of 3 synthetic peptides (35.1, 55.1, and 83.1) corresponding to portions of the 35 kDa, 55 kDa, and 83 kDa proteins from the asexual blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum and a polymer of a syntheic peptide incorporating the 3 individual peptides (SPf66) were tested as candidate malaria vaccine antigens in Aotus nancymai.  Monkeys were immunized with combinations of the 3 peptides from 2 separate sources (Centers for Disease Control [CDC], Atlanta, GA or Colombia) or with the synthetic polymer.  Animals immunized with a combination of the 3 peptides from CDC had higher antibody titers to the 35.1 and 55.1 peptides than to the 83.1 peptide.  Monkeys immunized with a combination of the 3 peptides produced in Colombia developed higher levels of antibody to the 55.1 than to the 83.1 and 35.1 peptides.  Animals immunized with the polymer produced detectable antibodies to the 55.1 peptide alone.  Following challenge with P.  falciparum, no differences were observed between the 3 vaccine groups and 2 control groups with respect to the number of animals with parasitemias greater than or equal to 10%.  The inconsistency of serologic response to all 3 peptides in these animals contrasted with previous trials performed in Colombia where the monkeys developed high antibody titers against the 3 peptides and were protected against the experimental infection.",2
"The use of liposuction to contour cherubism.  Yet another application of suction lipectomy equipment is presented to remove the pathologic tissue in cherubism.  Owing to the variations of consistency of the material in this condition, this technique may not be successful in all patients, but it is certainly recommended when indicated.",4
"Binding to human jejunum of serum IgA antibody from children with coeliac disease.  Jejunal histology and the presence of serum IgA antibodies (JAB) binding to human jejunum in vitro were studied in 139 children with severe malabsorptive symptoms.  Among 33 children with confirmed coeliac disease (ESPGAN criteria), 13 (93%) of 14 sampled before starting on a gluten-free diet had JAB, none of 21 sampled had JAB while on a gluten-free diet of long duration, and 90% of 30 sampled during gluten challenge had JAB.  53 children had severe jejunal villous atrophy (probable coeliac disease): 71% of those younger than 2 years and 94% of those aged 2-18 years had JAB during gluten intake.  JAB could not be detected in 53 disease control patients (normal jejunal histology) and in 3 coeliac disease patients with selective IgA deficiency.  Simultaneous determination of antigliadin (AGA) and antiendomysium (EMA) levels, and gliadin and tissue absorption studies, showed that JAB and AGA are different, whereas JAB and EMA are probably identical.  IgA JAB could be the target-organ-related autoantibodies in coeliac disease.",5
"Effects of diltiazem on the functional recovery of the myocardium at organ and cellular level during prolonged hypothermic ischemic cardiac arrest.  The effectiveness of diltiazem on the functional recovery of the heart, calcium (Ca++) uptake and binding, Ca++ ATPase of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), and MB fraction of creatine kinase (MBCK) of coronary sinus blood was investigated after one and a half hours of reperfusion following three hours of ischemic cardiac arrest.  The dogs were divided into three groups: group I, sham bypass; group II, cold crystalloid cardioplegia; and group III, cold crystalloid cardioplegia with diltiazem.  There was a decrease in aortic pressures left ventricular pressure development (dp/dt), left ventricular work index (LVWI), total systemic vascular resistance (TSVR), and left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP) in the sham bypass group.  There was a decrease in cardiac index (CI), LVWI, and mean right atrial pressure (mRAP) and an increase in TSVR and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in group II as compared with group I.  Although there was a tendency for a decrease in the indices of myocardial contractility in group II, they were not significantly different from those in group I.  The indices of myocardial contractility, CI, and LVWI in group III were slightly higher than in group II, but they were not significantly different from each other.  The values for calcium uptake by SR in groups II and III were similar but significantly lower than those in group I.  Calcium binding in group III was significantly lower than that in group I.  Calcium ATPase of SR in the three groups were similar.  Although MBCK increased in all the groups, the increases were not significantly different among the three groups.  The results of this study indicate that cold crystalloid cardioplegia with diltiazem was not better than cold crystalloid alone in preserving the cardiac contractility and cellular function during prolonged ischemic cardiac arrest.  However, the cardiac function in terms of cardiac index was better preserved with diltiazem.",13
"Gastric mucosal PGE2 levels in gastric non-ulcer and ulcer patients with chronic renal failure or without renal diseases and in healthy subjects.  PGE2-like immunoactivity in mucosal specimens from gastric corpus and antrum was measured in individuals with chronic uremia or without renal diseases in absence or presence of gastric ulcerations and in healthy subjects.  Regardless the group of patients, compared to normal mucosa, a significant decrease in PGE2-like immunoactivity (50-70%) was found in mucosa from atrophic, but not from superficial gastritis.  Whenever patients of the control group or patients with renal diseases suffered from ulcers, PGE2-like immunoactivity, compared to nonulcer subjects, revealed a decrease of about 60-70% in the nonulcerated mucosa.  Compared to nonulcerated mucosa, the tissue of the ulcer rim in all patients with gastric ulcer showed a relative increase in PGE2-like immunoactivity, eg, PGE2-like immunoactivity was twice as high in tissue from the ulcer rim.  The output of PGE2-like immunoactivity into the gastric juice of subjects without renal diseases was comparable to that found in patients with chronic uremia in both basal and pentagastrin-stimulated conditions.  We therefore conclude that gastric mucosal formation is probably not influenced by chronic uremia.",11
Treatment of idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis by immunosuppression.  Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis is exceedingly uncommon in childhood and its etiology is uncertain.  Support for an immunological basis for the disease is given by a report of a 14-year-old girl with severe retroperitoneal fibrosis causing progressive azotemia in whom azathioprine and prednisolone were used successfully.  This case supports the efficacy of immunotherapy in the treatment of idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis.,22
"Immunoproliferative small intestinal disease: portrait of a potentially preventable cancer from the Third World.  PURPOSE: To review the recent progress in the understanding of clinical and laboratory characterization as well as management of immunoproliferative small intestinal disease (IPSID).  DATA IDENTIFICATION: A literature search was conducted using Index Medicus, MEDLINE (1962 to 1989), and bibliographies of identified relevant articles.  STUDY SELECTION: All international comprehensive reviews, reported epidemiologic or immunologic studies, and prospective clinical trials published or abstracted in English were selected.  RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: A high incidence of lymphoma primarily in the gastro-intestinal tract in Third World countries has stimulated enormous epidemiologic and pathogenetic interests globally.  IPSID, with a distinctive biologic marker (alpha heavy chain para-protein), affects the young underprivileged population of those countries.  The initially benign-appearing antibiotic-responsive immunoproliferative lesions often evolve to fatal high-grade lymphomas.  Roles of environmental and host factors in this evolutionary course are emerging.  Recently demonstrated malignant potentials form the early onset of pathogenesis have given a new dimension to the traditional management strategy of IPSID.  CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiologic, immunologic, and pathogenetic data that have emerged over the last 25-year study of IPSID have improved our understanding about the complexity of infection-immunity-cancer interrelationships, comparable to those that have arisen from the study of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.  Early detection and institution of antimicrobial-based treatment regimens with judicious and consistent follow-up can save the lives of many young patients whose manpower is badly needed in Third World countries.",19
"Beta blockers and the primary prevention of nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with high blood pressure.  A population-based, case-control study was conducted to determine whether beta blockers, used for the treatment of high blood pressure, prevent first events of coronary heart disease.  All study subjects were health-maintenance organization enrollees with pharmacologically treated hypertension.  Patients presented in 1982 to 1984 with new coronary heart disease, and control subjects were a probability sample of eligible hypertensive enrollees free of coronary heart disease.  With the investigators blind to case-control status, the subjects' medical records were reviewed for other coronary risk factors, and the health-maintenance organization's computerized pharmacy database was used to ascertain the use of beta blockers.  A larger proportion of controls than cases were using beta blockers.  This difference was confined to the subgroup with nonfatal myocardial infarctions.  For current use, the estimated relative risk for nonfatal myocardial infarction was 0.62 (95% confidence interval, 0.39 to 0.99).  Among current users of beta blockers, higher doses conferred greater protection.  Past use and total lifetime intake of beta blockers were only weakly associated with case-control status.  The current use of beta blockers may prevent first events of nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with high blood pressure.",13
"Ultrastructural localization of proteinase 3, the target antigen of anti-cytoplasmic antibodies circulating in Wegener's granulomatosis.  To investigate the distribution of proteinase 3, the target antigen of anti-cytoplasmic antibodies (ACPA or C-ANCA), within the organelles of resting normal human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes, the authors used immunocytochemical techniques on thin frozen sections.  To obtain valuable tools for immunolabeling, two murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against the ACPA antigen were produced.  In neutrophils, the authors observed immunogold label for the ACPA antigen, predominantly in myeloperoxidase-positive azurophil granules, and in smaller amounts on the plasma membrane.  In monocytes, the ACPA antigen could be detected in small granules, which occasionally also contained myeloperoxidase, and rare labeling was found on the monocyte membrane.  The finding that the ACPA antigen is expressed on the plasma membrane of neutrophils and monocytes, thereby becoming accessible to circulating autoantibodies, supports the supposition that ACPA are not only markers of disease activity, but also are involved in the pathogenesis of Wegener's granulomatosis.",7
"Management of premature removal of the percutaneous gastrostomy.  Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) has become the preferred method of enteral access for nutritional support.  With increased use of this modality, complications are encountered more frequently.  Premature withdrawal, inadvertent removal of the gastrostomy tube within the first seven days after insertion, before adherence of the gastric serosa to the parietal peritoneum, has been an indication for laparotomy.  This report describes the treatment of premature withdrawal by immediate endoscopic replacement.  Over an 18-month period, 271 patients underwent insertion of a PEG.  Five patients (1.8%) who inadvertently removed their gastrostomy tube within seven days of insertion were treated with immediate replacement using the retrograde string technique, avoiding laparotomy.  All five PEGs were successfully replaced through the same gastrostomy site.  Despite the presence of pneumoperitoneum, no patient developed peritonitis or other septic complications.  Premature gastrostomy tube withdrawal is safely managed by endoscopic replacement and observation.  Laparotomy is unnecessary and potentially meddlesome.",22
"Diarrhea.  Diarrhea is one manifestation of GI disturbance.  Symptoms may be acute if caused by such things as infections, drug reactions, alterations in diet, heavy metal poisoning, or fecal impaction.  Chronic diarrhea is a symptom of GI diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome, lactase deficiency, cancer of the colon, inflammatory bowel disease, and malabsorption diseases.  Chronic diarrhea may also be associated with GI surgery, radiation therapy, laxative abuse, alcohol abuse, and chemotherapeutic agents.  When interventions are required to deal with diarrhea, they may include such things as alteration in tube feeding products and methods of administration, fluid replacement by oral rehydration procedures, a rapid return to feeding, and education aimed at the health information clients need to prevent or control the symptom of diarrhea.",5
"Mallory-Weiss syndrome after cardiopulmonary resuscitation.  We report hematemesis from Mallory-Weiss tears after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).  A computer search of the English language literature disclosed only 3 similar cases, and we review them.  This complication of CPR may occur more frequently than recognized and should be prevented by careful technique.",5
"The treatment of mesangial IgA nephropathy with cyclophosphamide, dipyridamole and warfarin: a two-year prospective trial.  Of 52 patients with mesangial IgA nephropathy, 25 were allocated to treatment with cyclophosphamide (6 months), and dipyridamole and warfarin (2 years) and 27 to no treatment in a randomized prospective 2-year study.  At entry, the treated and untreated groups of patients did not differ in mean serum creatinines, urinary protein excretions, quantitative urinary erythrocyte counts or blood pressure readings.  At the end of the trial mean (+/- SEM) serum creatinine values had gone from 0.12 +/- 0.01 to 0.13 +/- 0.01 mmol/l (p less than 0.05) in untreated patients and from 0.10 +/- 0.01 to 0.12 +/- 0.01 mmol/l (p less than 0.05) in treated patients.  Mean (+/- SEM) log values of urinary erythrocyte (rbc) counts had not changed significantly from 5.47 +/- 0.09 to 5.21 +/- 0.14 log rbc/ml in untreated patients, from 5.45 +/- 0.11 to 5.49 +/- 0.19 log rbc/ml in treated patients.  However, in treated patients, mean (+/- SEM) urinary protein excretions decreased from 1.67 +/- 0.35 to 1.15 +/- 0.31 g/24 h (p less than 0.01) whereas in untreated patients urinary protein was unchanged between initial values of 1.76 +/- 0.34 and follow-up at 1.89 +/- 0.45 g/24 h.  No significant changes in blood pressure occurred in either group.  This study supports the observation that treatment of IgA nephropathy with cyclophosphamide, dipyridamole and warfarin is associated with a reduction of urinary protein excretion but a significant effect on preservation of renal function, at least as determined by serum creatinine values, could not be confirmed over this two-year study.",11
"Promoting adherence to low-fat, low-cholesterol diets: review and recommendations.  Evidence that lowering blood cholesterol levels reduces risk of coronary heart disease has prompted widespread recommendations that hyperlipidemic individuals undergo dietary therapy.  However, the extent to which people can adopt and maintain diets to lower lipids is unclear.  In our article, we review what is currently known regarding adherence to low-fat diets and present an approach to dietary counseling for lowering cholesterol that incorporates elements of behavioral self-management and social learning theory.  We discuss specific recommendations for counseling hyperlipidemic patients based on the Dietary Alternatives Study.  Recommendations include providing patients with an adequate knowledge base to make dietary changes, using goal setting and self-monitoring to help patients initiate dietary changes, enlisting support from the patient's family, and enhancing self-efficacy to promote long-term dietary maintenance.",17
"The effect of somatostatin on 5-hydroxytryptamine release from a carcinoid tumor.  One of the major manifestations of the carcinoid syndrome is secretory diarrhea thought to be due to overproduction of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT).  Synthetic somatostatin analogues have proved to be clinically effective in controlling this diarrhea.  We have established a continuous cell line from a human pancreatic carcinoid tumor that secretes 5-HT.  We examined the ability of the somatostatin analogue, SMS 201-995, to inhibit 5-HT release in vitro.  Tumor cells were exposed to SMS 201-995 (10(-6) mol/L), pentagastrin (10(-9) mol/L), acetylcholine (10(-5) mol/L), and isoproterenol (10(-5) mol/L) alone and in combination; 5-HT release was assayed with high pressure liquid chromatography.  We found that pentagastrin (6.43 +/- 0.64 ng/ml), isoproterenol (20.24 +/- 2.17 ng/ml), and acetylcholine (12.39 +/- 1.10 ng/ml) each stimulated release of 5-HT compared to control values (4.38 +/- 0.42 ng/ml).  SMS 201-995 significantly reduced release of 5-HT in response to isoproterenol and acetylcholine but did not inhibit the effect of pentagastin.  These data suggest that different agents do not act through the same pathway to stimulate 5-HT release from human pancreatic carcinoid cells.",3
"The epidemiology of cancer among Hispanic women. The experience in Florida.  To explore cancer incidence among Hispanic women living in Dade County, Florida, data were analyzed from the statewide cancer registry.  For all but three sites, Hispanics had lower rates of the 15 most prevalent cancers than non-Hispanics.  However, higher rates of cancer among Hispanics were noted for cancers of the gallbladder, liver, and heart and soft tissue.  Subgroups of women had significantly higher rates of cervical cancer and thyroid cancer.  Lower rates among Hispanics were observed for cancers of the esophagus, vagina, breast, colon, buccal cavity and pharynx, and malignant melanoma.  These data suggest that most cancer sites traditionally higher among US Latino women were not higher among Dade Hispanics, and that sites more common among non-Hispanics have not yet shown an increased incidence among Hispanic women in Dade County.",3
"Age-related changes in membrane fluidity of erythrocytes in essential hypertension.  In the present study, age- and calcium-related changes in the membrane fluidity of erythrocytes were examined in patients with essential hypertension by use of electron spin resonance method (ESR).  The erythrocytes were obtained from patients with essential hypertension.  We examined the ESR spectra for a fatty acid spin label agent (5-nitroxy stearate) incorporated into the erythrocyte membranes.  The values of outer hyperfine splitting and order parameter (S) were significantly higher in subjects with essential hypertension than in the normotensive subjects.  This finding indicates that the membrane fluidity of erythrocytes was lower in essential hypertension.  Calcium-loading of erythrocytes with the Ca-ionophore A23187 decreased the membrane fluidity (S value was increased) more strongly in essential hypertension than in the normotensive subjects.  Furthermore, this Ca-induced change in membrane fluidity was significantly correlated with age in essential hypertension.  These results demonstrate that the membrane fluidity of erythrocytes is markedly decreased by calcium, especially in essential hypertension in older patients.  This suggests an increased calcium-sensitivity of cell membranes in the aged hypertensive patient.",13
"Magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of vitreoretinal disease in eyes with intraocular silicone oil.  Media opacification in eyes filled with silicone oil makes the evaluation of recurrent retinal detachment difficult.  Ultrasonography through silicone oil is subject to significant imaging artifacts.  We performed magnetic resonance imaging on six patients with unilateral intravitreal silicone oil to determine if the technique would detect detached retina and subretinal oil.  All patients had undergone pars plana vitrectomy with silicone oil injection for proliferative vitreoretinopathy; five patients had encircling solid silicone scleral buckles.  In five patients the media were clear, and ophthalmoscopic findings were correlated with magnetic resonance findings.  Four patients had recurrence of inferior retinal detachment; magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated subretinal oil in three of these patients.  One patient had a concentric, shallow, anterior retinal detachment; magnetic resonance scanning demonstrated a globular hyperintensity suggestive of subretinal oil.  In the sixth patient, who had an opaque cornea, magnetic resonance imaging suggested that the retina was attached preoperatively; this was confirmed at subsequent surgery.  A chemical shift artifact was helpful in defining the contour of retinal detachments and the presence of subretinal oil by outlining the silicone oil within the eye.",10
"Hemodynamic effects of nebivolol at rest and on exertion in patients with heart failure.  Nebivolol is a novel B-1-adrenoceptor-blocking drug with an unusual hemodynamic profile unlike classical B-blockers.  In dogs and in healthy volunteers it decreases blood pressure and heart rate but improves left ventricular function.  The authors studied 10 male patients with coronary artery disease and heart failure (ejection fraction mean = 46%).  A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed into the pulmonary artery, and the mean blood pressure, the heart rate, the pulmonary artery pressure, the pulmonary wedge pressure, the right atrial pressure, the cardiac output, and the stroke volume were measured at rest and on exertion before and after seven days' treatment with oral nebivolol (5 mg/day).  While the blood pressure and the heart rate decreased significantly, the pulmonary artery and wedge pressures, as well as the right atrial pressure and the cardiac output, did not change during treatment.  The stroke volume increased significantly.  The maintained cardiac output cannot be explained by any changes in preload or afterload; instead a positive inotropic mechanism must be assumed.  Unlike other B-blockers it seems to be possible to treat patients with heart failure with nebivolol without causing the hemodynamic situation to deteriorate.",13
"Left ventricular versus left atrial cannulation for the Thoratec ventricular assist device.  In a retrospective study of 28 patients (23 men, 5 women) supported with ventricular assist devices greater than 3 days, the effect of LV cannulation versus LA cannulation on device performance was compared.  Patients ranged in age from 12 to 67 years (mean 46 years) and were supported for 3-81 days (mean 15 years).  Fifteen patients were supported with left VADs (6 LV and 9 LA), and 13 patients were supported with BVADs (5 LV and 8 LA).  The mode of operation 91% of the time was the fill-to-empty mode.  Ten data points were taken for each patient.  LV cannulation results in higher VAD flow index at decreased preload, lower VAD systolic and vacuum pressures, and shorter diastolic durations.  Eleven of the 28 patients survived.  Although survival was greater in patients with LV cannulation, survival was more dependent upon reversibility of myocardial damage, eligibility for transplantation, or the development of complications.  These data indicate that LV cannulation provides better VAD performance than LA cannulation in the fill-to-empty mode.",13
"Primary splenic lymphocyte-depletion Hodgkin's disease.  A case of lymphocyte-depletion Hodgkin's disease is described for the purpose of reviewing the criteria currently used to distinguish this disease from other pleomorphic large-cell malignancies.  A 76-year-old man with a 3-month history of daily fevers underwent extensive evaluation and exploratory laparotomy, which revealed only two large, separate splenic tumor nodules.  Postoperatively, the patient remained asymptomatic.  Histologically, the tumor was composed of giant cells, including both typical Reed-Sternberg forms and mononuclear variants with inflammatory stromal response along its borders.  Immunoperoxidase showed tumor cells to be strongly reactive for Leu-M1 (CD15), BER-H2 (CD30), Leu-3 (CD4), and T11 (CD2) and weakly reactive for Leu-4 (CD3) but nonreactive for EMA, LCA, lysozyme, Leu-9, Leu-M3, Leu-M5, and immunoglobulin light chains.  Southern blot analysis revealed an isolated clonal band for kappa light chain only.  Included in the discussion of this case of primary splenic lymphocyte-depletion Hodgkin's disease is a review of clinical, histologic, immunohistochemical, and gene-rearrangement characteristics of what can be defined as lymphocyte-depletion Hodgkin's disease.",14
"Aberrant morphogenesis of the central nervous system.  This overview of congenital defects of the CNS has emphasized pathogenesis.  As developmental pathways continue to be elucidated, this approach remains to an extent hypothetical.  When, however, an understanding of the features of morphogenesis and dysmorphogenesis helps to indicate time of onset or to elucidate causal factors, important steps toward the prevention of birth defects are taken.",15
"In vitro and in vivo testing of a new valved intravascular catheter design.  Long-term intravascular catheterization carries a finite risk of catheter occlusion.  A catheter tip valve design is presented (Buchwald-Wigness, Strato Medical Corporation, Beverly, MA) which incorporates features designed to decrease the risk of thromboembolism and reduce the need for maintenance procedures.  Aspiration and infusion are controlled by separate valves, making it possible to engineer optimized inlet and outlet parameters.  The outlet valve is an elastic sleeve expanded around the sidewall outlet ports which opens under injection pressure.  The inlet valve is a tubular elastic element compressed against the inlet port from within the lumen, opening under aspiration pressure.  A series of valves were prototyped with outlet pressures ranging from 2 to 100"" H2O, and inlet pressures ranging from -40-70"" H2O, and flowrates at 36"" H2O of greater than 1,400 ml/hr.  Dog implants of two prototypes with outlet valve pressures of 10"" H2O, and inlet pressures of -40"" H2O, demonstrated that dormant periods of up to 7.5 weeks could be achieved without detectable blood cell entry into the lumen.  No significant hemolysis was observed in blood samples aspirated with a 6 cc syringe (8% scored ""slightly hemolyzed"" vs.  44% with the nonvalved controls) indicating that a hemodialysis application is likely.",13
"Characteristics of cholinergic neuroeffector transmission of ganglionic and aganglionic colon in Hirschsprung's disease.  Differences in the release and content of acetylcholine and the alpha 2 adrenoceptor mediated interaction between noradrenergic and cholinergic neurons were investigated by neurochemical and pharmacological methods in aganglionic and ganglionic segments of isolated human colon taken from children suffering from Hirschsprung's disease.  Both at rest and during transmural stimulation the release of acetylcholine was significantly higher in the spastic (aganglionic) segment than in the proximal dilated bowel.  Significant differences were found in the tissue concentration of acetylcholine between ganglionic and aganglionic specimens.  The pattern of response to transmural stimulation was also different in the spastic and dilated bowel.  Transmural stimulation induced relaxation and contraction in ganglionic specimens but only contractions in aganglionic specimens.  The sensitivity of the smooth muscle in the aganglionic portion to exogenous acetylcholine and to field stimulation was found to be higher than in the ganglionic portion.  While noradrenaline added to the organ bath reduced the stimulation-evoked release of acetylcholine from spastic segments, via an alpha 2 adrenoceptor mediated process, yohimbine did not enhance the release.  It is suggested that in Hirschsprung's disease the increased acetylcholine release, the enhanced sensitivity of smooth muscle cells to acetylcholine, and the lack of alpha 2 adrenoceptor mediated noradrenergic modulation of acetylcholine release from cholinergic interneurons might be responsible for the spasm of aganglionic segments.",15
"Spatiotemporal contrast sensitivity differs in normal aging and Parkinson's disease.  We measured contrast sensitivity for static and laterally drifting vertical gratings in 12 young adults, 7 normal elderly adults, and 8 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).  We compared static and motion contrast sensitivity for spatial frequencies of 0.25, 1, and 4 cycles per degree (cpd), and temporal frequencies of 1, 3, and 9 Hz.  Results show that normal aging leads to a reduction of motion sensitivity for the spatial frequency of 0.25 cpd.  Compared with elderly controls, PD patients do not present specific abnormalities in this domain.  However, for spatial frequencies of 1 and 4 cpd and temporal frequencies of 1 and 3 Hz, motion sensitivity is worse than static sensitivity in PD patients and not in elderly controls.  These findings suggest a specific deficit of motion perception in PD, and possible dopaminergic involvement in the control of visuospatial behavior.",9
"Comparison of ventricular arrhythmia induction with use of an indwelling electrode catheter and a newly inserted catheter.  Two methods of serial electrophysiologic testing are in widespread use.  Most commonly, the electrode catheter is removed after each study and a new catheter reinserted through the femoral vein for every subsequent test.  An alternative method employs an electrode catheter that remains in place during several days of serial testing.  Little is known about differences between these two methods with respect to the likelihood of induction of arrhythmia or the frequency of complications.  To determine whether inducibility of sustained arrhythmia is altered or if the frequency of complications is unacceptably high with use of an indwelling catheter, a prospective randomized study was conducted in 78 patients.  Each patient underwent baseline testing, several days of electropharmacologic testing with an indwelling catheter, a 24 h drug elimination period and placement of a new electrode catheter.  Ventricular stimulation studies were then performed in each patient with both the indwelling and new electrode catheters.  No differences were found between the indwelling and new catheter tests with respect to induction of arrhythmia, number of extrastimuli required to induce arrhythmia, rate of arrhythmia or requirement for cardioversion.  Ventricular pacing thresholds were higher and effective refractory periods were slightly longer when measured with the indwelling catheter.  Complications related to the 156 catheter insertions included two that may have been related to the indwelling catheter (one episode of staphylococcal sepsis and one presumed pulmonary embolism) and four that were related to invasive procedures (pneumothorax in all).  There were no long-term adverse sequelae of these complications.",22
"Efficacy and safety of low- and high-dose sotalol versus propranolol in the prevention of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias early after coronary artery bypass operations.  Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias are reported in up to 40% of patients early after coronary artery bypass graft operations.  In a randomized study, we compared the efficacy and safety of the class III antiarrhythmic beta-blocking drug sotalol versus propranolol at low and high doses in the prevention of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias in 429 consecutive patients after coronary artery bypass graft operations.  Patients with severely depressed left ventricular function and other contraindications for beta-blockers were excluded.  From the fourth hour up to the sixth day after coronary artery bypass, 74 patients received low-dose sotalol (40 mg every 8 hours), 66 patients low-dose propranolol (10 mg every 6 hours), 133 patients high-dose sotalol (80 mg every 8 hours), and 156 patients high-dose propranolol (20 mg every 6 hours).  Baseline characteristics were comparable in all groups.  Supraventricular tachyarrhythmia was observed in 10 of 72 (13.9%) who received low-dose sotalol, 12 of 64 (18.8%) who received low-dose propranolol, 13 of 119 (10.9%) who received high-dose sotalol, and 19 of 139 (13.7%) who received high-dose propranolol (not significant).  Drug-related adverse effects necessitating discontinuation of the drug occurred in four receiving low doses (2.9%) and in 31 receiving high doses (10.7%) (p less than 0.02).  In conclusion, no medication was found to be superior, although supraventricular tachyarrhythmias tended to be less prevalent in patients treated with sotalol than in those treated with propranolol.  Moreover, significantly fewer adverse effects were noted in both low-dose groups.  Therefore, low-dose beta-blocking treatment, especially low-dose sotalol, seems preferable.",13
"Dependence of oxygen consumption on oxygen delivery in children with hyperdynamic septic shock and low oxygen extraction.  We studied the effect of increasing systemic oxygen delivery (DO2) by packed RBC (PRBC) transfusion on oxygen consumption (VO2) in children with hyperdynamic septic shock.  After routine resuscitation with volume loading and pharmacologic support, patients were studied if they had significant derangements of oxygen transport variables defined as: baseline VO2 less than 180 ml/min.m2 and oxygen extraction (O2 extr) less than 24%.  Eight studies were performed.  PRBC transfusion increased DO2 from 636 +/- 167 to 828 +/- 266 ml/min.m2 (p less than .01) without increasing cardiac index (5.2 +/- 1.3 vs.  5.0 +/- 1.4 L/min.m2).  VO2 increased from 112 +/- 36 to 157 +/- 60 ml/min.m2 (p less than .01) while O2 extr was unchanged (18 +/- 3% vs.  19 +/- 6%).  Despite initial low O2 extr, VO2 can be increased in pediatric septic shock by a further increase in DO2.  Since VO2 correlates with survival, one should consider enhancing DO2 further despite initial low O2 extr and high DO2.  Effects on morbidity and mortality require further study.",0
"Potential usefulness of combined thromboxane A2 and serotonin receptor blockade for preventing the conversion from chronic to acute coronary artery disease syndromes.  Evidence suggests that unstable angina, non-Q-wave myocardial infarction and Q-wave myocardial infarcts represent a continuum, such that transient reduction in coronary blood flow associated with platelet aggregation and dynamic vasoconstriction at sites of coronary artery stenosis and endothelial injury lead to abrupt development of unstable angina.  Factors potentially responsible for the conversion from chronic to acute coronary artery disease include endothelial injury at sites of stenosis.  The endothelial injury may be the result of plaque fissuring or ulceration, hemodynamic factors (including systemic arterial hypertension or flow shear stress), infection, smoking, coronary arteriography or balloon angioplasty.  Clinical and experimental animal studies suggest that interference with thromboxane and serotonin contributions to platelet aggregation and dynamic coronary artery constriction may prevent chronic coronary artery disease syndromes from converting to acute disease.  To protect against this process may require both thromboxane and serotonin receptor antagonists or a combination of thromboxane synthesis inhibitor and receptor antagonist with a serotonin receptor antagonist.  Further studies are needed to test this hypothesis.",13
"Left main percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with the autoperfusion catheter in an animal model.  Left main coronary angioplasty is associated with high risk because of interruption of blood flow to much of the left ventricle during balloon inflation.  An ""autoperfusion"" balloon angioplasty catheter that allows blood to flow passively distal to an inflated balloon was tested in dogs and compared with inflations with standard balloon catheters.  During 3 min occlusions of the left main coronary artery with the autoperfusion catheter, regional myocardial blood flow was preserved at 0.60 +/- 0.14 ml/min/g, compared with 0.07 +/- 0.03 ml/min/g during inflation with standard balloon catheters (P less than 0.01).  Similarly, at the end of 3 min of inflation, left ventricular systolic pressure and dP/dt were maintained with autoperfusion catheter inflation, but they were severely depressed after standard angioplasty balloon inflation.  All seven dogs survived autoperfusion balloon inflation, whereas five of seven developed sustained ventricular tachycardia and/or ventricular fibrillation during or after standard balloon inflation.  Thus, distal blood flow, hemodynamics, and survival were preserved during autoperfusion balloon inflation in the left main coronary artery.",13
"Blunt traumatic pericardial rupture. A ten-year experience 1979 to 1989.  Blunt traumatic pericardial rupture is rarely diagnosed preoperatively and is associated with high mortality.  During a ten-year period from 1979 to 1989 over 20,000 patients were admitted to a major trauma center and 22 were found to have blunt traumatic pericardial rupture.  Sixteen of the 22 (72.7%) were injured in vehicle accidents, 3 (13.6%) in motorcycle crashes, and 2 (9.1%) in falls; 1 (4.5%) was crushed.  Eighteen (81.8%) were diagnosed intraoperatively during resuscitation or surgery for associated injuries, and four (18.1%) were diagnosed preoperatively with pericardial window.  Eighteen were males and four were females.  The median age was 40.14 years (range, 17 to 68).  The tears were found at the following sites: left pleuropericardial (14/22 [64%]), diaphragmatic (4/22 [18%]), right pleuropericardial (2/22 [9%]), and superior mediastinal (2/22 [9%]).  Associated cardiac injuries were found in only 5 of the 22 (22.7%); all of those patients died.  The overall mortality rate was 63.6% (14/22).  A high index of suspicion should alert the trauma surgeon to make the diagnosis intraoperatively during emergency surgical resuscitation in the hemodynamically unstable patient and by pericardial window in the stable patient.",20
"What causes cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis? A case-control study of environmental exposure to dust.  OBJECTIVE--To investigate the role of occupational and domestic exposure to dust in the aetiology of cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis.  DESIGN--Matched case-control study.  SUBJECTS--40 Patients with cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis and 106 community controls matched for age and sex who responded to a questionnaire.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Responses to self administered questionnaire asking about lifetime exposure to dust, animals, and smoke at home and at work.  RESULTS--The patients with cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis were more likely to report occupational exposure to metal dust (matched odds ratio 10.97 (95% confidence interval 2.30 to 52.4), p less than 0.001) or wood dust (2.94 (0.87 to 9.90), p = 0.08), to have worked with cattle (10.89 (1.24 to 96.0), p = 0.01), and to have lived in a house heated by a wood fire (12.55 (1.04 to 114), p = 0.009).  A history of smoking and social class based on occupation were not significantly related to disease state.  CONCLUSION--Environmental exposure to dust may be an important factor in the aetiology of cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis.",7
"Codeine increases pain thresholds to copper vapor laser stimuli in extensive but not poor metabolizers of sparteine.  The analgesic efficacy and kinetics of a single oral dose of 75 mg codeine was investigated in 12 extensive metabolizers and 12 poor metabolizers of sparteine in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study.  The cosegregation of the O-demethylation of codeine to morphine with the sparteine oxidation polymorphism was confirmed.  Hence morphine could not be detected in the plasma of any of the poor metabolizers, whereas detectable morphine plasma levels were found in 10 of 12 extensive metabolizers.  Pain thresholds to laser stimuli were determined before drug intake and 90, 150, and 210 minutes after drug intake.  Codeine significantly increased the pricking pain thresholds in the extensive metabolizers (p less than 0.05), whereas there were no significant changes in the poor metabolizers.  No change in pain thresholds occurred with placebo in any of the two phenotypes.  In the extensive metabolizers there was a significant positive correlation between the increase in pain threshold and plasma concentration of codeine.  The study supports the hypothesis that morphine formation is essential for achievement of analgesia during codeine treatment.",9
"B cell responses to paramyosin. Isotypic analysis and epitope mapping of filarial paramyosin in patients with onchocerciasis.  To examine the fine specificity of the human immune response to filarial paramyosin, the antigenicity of an expressed rcDNA (2.55 kb) of Dirofilaria immitis paramyosin was detailed by ELISA.  Using sera from patients infected with Onchocerca volvulus, we analyzed both the entire paramyosin molecule and six subcloned fragments for their IgG, IgG subclasses, and IgE responses.  Patients from both Guatemala (64% positive) and Ghana (100% positive) reacted to paramyosin with specific IgG levels above normal controls.  Although there was no anti-paramyosin subclass restriction common to all patients, the IgG3 response in the Ghananians was significantly greater than that of Guatemalans (p less than 0.001).  IgE anti-paramyosin responses showed positive correlations with IgG2 (p less than 0.001), IgG4 (p less than 0.002), and IgG1 (p less than 0.04) responses.  Epitope mapping using the IgG response to the six subclones demonstrated preferential recognition of the amino terminal end of the molecule (nucleotides 1 to 360).  IgG2 reactivity was clearly localized to the most amino-terminal 120 amino acids, and the IgG4 antibodies recognized amino acids immediately adjacent to this fragment.  These studies examining the fine specificity of anti-filarial immune reactions should provide a method for understanding how parasites either evade or induce host immune responses.",2
"Adenoid cystic carcinoma: a comparison between CT, MR and Gd MR imaging techniques.  Nasopharyngeal carcinoma continues to be a difficult diagnostic problem in many patients.  It is well known that amongst the many and varied manifestations of this disease, a unilateral middle ear effusion in an adult should be regarded with suspicion.  Such a case in a 42-year-old patient is presented.  In this case the benefit of Gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging over and above computerized tomography is demonstrated.",8
"Sphincter of Oddi manometry: decreased risk of clinical pancreatitis with use of a modified aspirating catheter.  This study was undertaken to determine whether routine use of a modified triple-lumen five French sphincter of Oddi manometry catheter would reduce the frequency and severity of post-manometry pancreatitis and pancreatic enzyme elevation.  Seventy-six patients were alternately assigned to undergo sphincter of Oddi manometry (SOM) with a standard perfusion (infused group) catheter or the newly developed aspiration (aspirated group) catheter.  After SOM, there were significantly more patients in the infused group with both amylase and lipase values elevated at least two times the upper limits of normal at 2 (p less than 0.001), 6 (p = 0.01), and 18 hours (p = 0.03) after the procedure.  As compared with the standard perfusion system, the aspiration catheter was associated with a decreased frequency of clinical pancreatitis (23.5% vs.  3%, p = 0.01) reduced hospital stay (5 +/- 1.83 days, mean +/- SE, versus 1 day; p = 0.03) and milder pancreatitis.  The aspiration manometry catheter should be considered for standard use for SOM, particularly if the pancreatic duct sphincter is being evaluated.",5
"Selenium. Nutritional, toxicologic, and clinical aspects   Despite the recent findings of environmental contamination, selenium toxicosis in humans is exceedingly rare in the United States, with the few known cases resulting from industrial accidents and an episode involving the ingestion of superpotent selenium supplements.  Chronic selenosis is essentially unheard of in this country because of the typical diversity of the American diet.  Nonetheless, because of the growing public interest in selenium as a dietary supplement and the occurrence of environmental selenium contamination, medical practitioners should be familiar with the nutritional, toxicologic, and clinical aspects of this trace element.",3
"Carboplatin in childhood brain tumors. A Children's Cancer Study Group Phase II trial.  Between October 1985 and March 1988, Children's Cancer Study Group institutions entered 95 patients with recurrent brain tumors into a Phase II trial of carboplatin 560 mg/m2 every 4 weeks.  Complete or partial responses were observed for one of 19 evaluable children with brainstem glioma, two of 14 with ependymoma, six of 19 with medulloblastoma or central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET), and none of 15 with high-grade astrocytoma.  Of 33 children with medulloblastoma, ependymoma, or central nervous system PNET, five of 12 with no prior cisplatin exposure had responses, and two of 21 with prior cisplatin exposure had responses (P = 0.03).  Thirty-four percent of patients had absolute neutrophil count nadirs less than 500/microliters, and 37% had platelet count nadirs less than 25,000/microliters.  Sixteen percent had moderate to severe otoxicity, 10% had nausea and vomiting, and none had nephrotoxicity.",3
Effects of screws and a sleeve on initial fixation in uncemented total knee tibial components.  Aseptic loosening of tibial components remains a serious problem in uncemented total knee arthroplasties.  Achieving rigid initial fixation of porous-coated components is one of the most important factors in promoting bone ingrowth.  The results of a biomechanical study for micromovement of the tibial component under posteroanterior shear and axial compressive loading are presented.  Forty anatomic specimen tibiae were stress tested on a servohydraulic mechanical test machine to evaluate the effects of screws and a sleeve on initial fixation of the uncemented total knee tibial component.  Twenty specimens were used for posteroanterior shear loading and 20 for anterolateral axial compressive loading.  Four cancellous screws were inserted through holes of the tibial tray to pierce the cortex of the proximal tibia.  The methylmethacrylate sleeve was applied to the central stem.  Rigidity of fixation was significantly improved by the combination of screws and a sleeve.  Bone strength was also an important factor affecting the quality of fixation.,22
"Early 24-hour blood pressure elevation in normotensive subjects with parental hypertension   Subjects with a family history of parental hypertension are reported to have a slightly higher office blood pressure in the prehypertensive stage.  Whether this reflects a hyperreactivity to blood pressure measurement or a more permanent blood pressure elevation, however, is not known.  In the present study, blood pressure was measured in 15 normotensive subjects whose parents are both hypertensive (FH++), 15 normotensive subjects with one hypertensive parent (FH(+)-), and 15 normotensive subjects whose parents are not hypertensive (FH--); among the three groups, subjects were matched for age, sex, and body mass index.  The measurements were made in the office during a variety of laboratory stressors and during a prolonged resting period, and for a 24-hour period (ambulatory blood pressure monitoring).  Office blood pressure was higher in the FH++ group than in the FH-- group (p less than 0.05).  The pressor responses to laboratory stressors were similar in the two groups, but the FH++ group had higher prolonged resting and 24-hour blood pressure than the FH-- group; the difference was always significant (p less than 0.05) for systolic blood pressure.  The FH++ group also had a greater left ventricular mass index (on echocardiographic examination) than the FH-- group (p less than 0.01).  The blood pressure values and echocardiographic values of the FH(+)- group tended to be between those of the other two groups.  Thus, the higher blood pressure shown by individuals in the prehypertensive stage with a family history of parental hypertension does not reflect a hyperreactivity to stress but an early permanent blood pressure elevation.",13
"In vivo selection and characterization of a murine mammary tumor subline with high potential for spontaneous lymph node metastasis.  A transplantable mammary adenocarcinoma, grown in Balb/c mice, with a marked enhancement in its draining lymph node metastatic ability (MM3LN), was obtained through an in vivo procedure from a variant tumor moderately metastatic to lymph nodes (MM3).  Both MM3 and MM3LN presented a similar latency and tumor growth rate and reached the same tumor mean diameter at death.  MM3LN tumor-bearing mice exhibited a larger mean survival time.  The new variant showed a 2.5-fold higher incidence of tumor-draining lymph node metastases than MM3 line, with no differences in the incidence of lung metastases.  Morphology as well as cytogenetic and in vitro adhesion properties were studied in order to characterize the new subline.  This murine tumor model has potential application in the study of the metastatic process in lymphoid tissue.",3
"Angiotropic (intravascular) large cell lymphoma. A clinicopathologic study of seven cases with unique clinical presentations.  The authors recently reported the antigenic phenotypes of three cases of so-called ""malignant angioendotheliomatosis"" and suggested that angiotropic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a more appropriate designation for this disease.  The authors now report an additional seven cases of ALCL with unique clinical presentations.  One patient presented with prostate enlargement, the second with lytic bone lesions and thickened nasal sinus mucosa, the third had diffuse myalgia, the fourth had dyspnea and pulmonary infiltrates, the fifth had gangrene of the lower extremities, total-body skin involvement, and pancytopenia, the sixth had a lesion of the foreskin mimicking squamous cell carcinoma, and the seventh had a mediastinal mass.  In all cases histologic features were characteristic of ALCL with, in two cases, extravascular spread into soft tissue.  Immunohistologic studies showed a B-cell phenotype in five cases and a T-cell phenotype in one case.  Two patients received combination chemotherapy using established treatment protocol for large cell lymphoma, and remain in complete clinical remission and two patients are responding clinically to combination chemotherapy.  Two patients died shortly after receiving combination chemotherapy.  One patient has only recently been diagnosed as having ALCL and no long-term follow-up is available.  These data indicate that, although ALCL affects predominantly the central nervous system and skin, unusual clinical presentations may occur, and patients with ALCL may respond to combination chemotherapy for large cell lymphoma.",19
"Glaucoma screening: too little, too late?  Screening for glaucoma, usually by measuring intraocular pressure, has been popular, but repeated analysis indicates poor sensitivity and specificity.  More extensive testing is required.  Such testing should be focused on high-risk groups, including blacks and the elderly.  Regular comprehensive eye examinations, on a schedule adjusted for these and other risk factors, are probably the most cost-efficient means of identifying patients with glaucoma.  The primary care provider has a pivotal role: to encourage patients to undergo such examinations when warranted; and to encourage those on intraocular-pressure-lowering medications to comply with their medication use.",10
"Trimming of the inferior turbinates: a prospective long-term study.  The aim of this study was to determine whether the initial benefits of radical trimming and anterior trimming of the inferior turbinates on nasal airflow persisted in the long term.  Radical trimming significantly reduced nasal resistance at 2 months following operation (n = 12) (P less than 0.005).  There was no significant change in nasal resistance over the next 20 months.  Symptom scores for nasal obstruction also showed a significant reduction (n = 16) (P less than 0.005), at 2 months, and did not change significantly over the next 20 months.  Radical trimming of the inferior turbinates is a highly effective operation in patients with hypertrophy of the inferior turbinates with few initial complications.  However, further analysis of the data revealed that up to 20% of patients lose the initial subjective benefit of relief of nasal obstruction within 2 years of follow-up.  Late onset crusting occurs in some patients though this is not directly attributable to an increase in nasal airflow.  This study also concludes that anterior trimming of the inferior turbinates cannot be recommended as a form of treatment.",7
"Detection and location of myocardial infarction using technetium-99m sestamibi imaging at rest.  Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) sestamibi imaging at rest has been used to detect and localize myocardial infarction.  The largest study to date is a cooperative study of 146 patients in 17 institutions.  There were 24 normal subjects and 122 patients with documented myocardial infarction based on clinical, enzymatic or electrocardiographic criteria.  The presence of segmental myocardial perfusion defects was compared to the presence of a Q wave on the electrocardiogram or wall motion abnormality on gated blood pool scans, performed within 48 hours of the Tc-99m sestamibi study.  Of the 122 infarct patients, 118 (97%) showed perfusion abnormalities by Tc-99m sestamibi imaging.  A perfusion defect was found in 110 (99%) of 111 patients with a Q wave and a wall motion abnormality, 113 (99%) of 114 patients with a wall motion abnormality and 113 (98%) of 115 patients with a Q wave.  Of the 24 normal subjects, 22 (92%) had normal Tc-99m sestamibi images.  In 75% of 1,986 segments, both a Tc-99m sestamibi defect and a regional wall motion abnormality on gated blood scans were present.  In 11% of segments, wall motion was normal but Tc-99m sestamibi imaging was abnormal; in 14% of segments, wall motion was abnormal and Tc-99m sestamibi images were normal.  In the 24 control subjects, 99% of the segments were normal.  Thirty-eight patients had coronary angiography.  A close relation existed between the coronary anatomy and myocardial Tc-99m sestamibi uptake.  All 9 territories supplied by an occluded vessel and poor collaterals had grade 0 uptake (scale 0 to 2: 0 = markedly reduced; 2 = normal).",13
"Bacterial lipopolysaccharide transforms mesangial into proliferative lupus nephritis without interfering with processing of pathogenic immune complexes in NZB/W mice.  Systemic lupus erythematosus is a multifactorial systemic disease in which genetic, immunologic, hormonal, and environmental factors may contribute to disease pathogenesis.  Bacterial products (eg, bacterial lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) induce a lupuslike disease in normal mice and trigger an early and accelerated form of lupus nephritis in NZB/W mice.  To investigate whether the mechanism by which LPS accelerates nephritis in the NZB/W mice involves interference with processing of immune complexes (IC), we administered LPS to NZB/W mice for 5 weeks and probed the kinetics of removal, liver uptake, and organ localization of a subsaturating dose of radiolabeled IC (2.5 mg of bovine serum albumin-antibovine serum albumin).  Control NZB/W mice received vehicle (saline) alone.  In NZB/W exposed to LPS, features of polyclonal B-cell activation (PBA) were enhanced, anti-DNA antibodies were raised, and a proliferative glomerulonephritis developed that was associated with renal insufficiency and substantial proteinuria.  This LPS-accelerated nephritis could not be attributed to altered complement concentration, to altered blood cell carrier function, to delayed removal of pathogenic (large-sized) ICs from the circulation, to impaired liver uptake of ICs, or to enhanced localization of ICs in kidney.  The findings indicate that transformation of nephritis is probably the result of LPS-induced PBA, that defective processing of pathogenic IC is not a contributory factor to nephritis, and that mechanisms other than passive renal localization of circulating ICs must be operative.",19
"HTLV-I sequences are not detected in peripheral blood genomic DNA or in brain cDNA of multiple sclerosis patients.  Human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-I) was recently reported to be etiologically associated with multiple sclerosis (MS).  Genomic DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes and brain plaques of patients with MS was analyzed for the presence of sequences homologous to the HTLV-I pol gene using the polymerase chain reaction and dot blot techniques.  Comparison of DNA amplification patterns between patients with MS, and with control subjects who have other autoimmune conditions, with those in healthy control subjects and with an HTLV-I-infected cell line indicates that HTLV-I pol sequence is not present in the peripheral blood of patients with MS, and that the virus is not active in MS brain plaques.",19
"Treatment of hirsutism with the pure antiandrogen flutamide.  The effectiveness of the antiandrogen flutamide in combination with an oral contraceptive was studied in 20 patients with moderate to severe hirsutism.  Eight patients had no previous therapy, whereas 12 had failed to respond to oral contraceptives, spironolactone, or dexamethasone therapy.  Treatment with the antiandrogen flutamide (250 mg twice daily) and an oral contraceptive (Ortho 1/35) resulted in a particularly rapid and marked decrease in the total hirsutism score, which reached the normal range at 7 months.  Seborrhea, acne, and hair loss score were also rapidly corrected.  Treatment was associated with a decrease in plasma luteinizing hormone, progesterone, and estradiol levels.  Plasma sex hormone-binding globulin levels were initially low in 18 to 20 patients but increased significantly during therapy.  No clinically significant side effects were observed.",16
"Genomic divergence of an HIV-2 from a German AIDS patient probably infected in Mali.  The complete nucleotide sequence of an HIV-2 isolate derived from a German AIDS patient with predominantly neurological symptoms is reported.  The HIV-2BEN sequence is highly divergent from those of previously described HIV-2 and SIV strains.  Evolutionary tree analysis of eight HIV-2 sequences reveals the existence of three HIV-2 groups.  HIV-2BEN belongs to a group with two isolates from Ghana and The Gambia.  Based on a comparison of HIV-2BEN with six HIV-2 isolates, SIVsmm and SIVmac, the variability of the structural env and gag proteins is similar within the HIV-2/SIVsmm/mac and HIV-1 groups.  In contrast, the regulatory HIV-1 proteins are more highly conserved than those from HIV-2 strains.  Multiple sequence alignments reveal that some domains of the envelope and regulatory proteins are well conserved among HIV-1, HIV-2/SIVsmm/mac, SIVagm and SIVmnd.  The identification of conserved domains within the external glycoprotein could help to develop broadly active vaccines.",19
"Triiodothyronine and brain excitability.  We investigated mechanisms involved in thyroid hormone action on brain excitability.  The effect of acute exposure of triiodothyronine (T3) to rat hippocampal slices in vitro was studied.  No significant changes could be detected in prevolley, field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) and population spike amplitude, while there was a minor, nonsignificant trend toward shortening of the population spike latency time.  T3 had no effect on penicillin-induced epileptiform activity.  There was, however, an active accumulation of radioactively labeled T3 in the slices.  A rat cervaux-isole preparation was used to determine focal seizure thresholds in the visual cortex, and no acute (2-4 h) effects were demonstrated.  No significant acute effects of T3 on brain excitability in the hippocampus and visual cortex was observed, despite an active accumulation of T3.  Thus, the effect of T3 on brain excitability most likely is due to delayed effects.",9
"Medical treatment of juvenile arthritis.  The range of medications available to treat juvenile arthritis has markedly expanded over the past 15 years.  Multiple new nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are available in the United States, although only a few are approved for use in children, and none have been proven to be significantly better than aspirin in suppressing inflammation.  The average time before significant improvement is noticed is over 30 days in the 50% of the children who respond to any NSAID within three months.  The percentage of responders progressively increases with the length of therapy, so treatment should be continued until one is reasonably certain that improvement will not occur before changing medication.  In the more severely involved child, gold and other disease-modifying medications are used.  However, it has been difficult to prove the value of these medications in controlled studies because of the high rate of significant improvement in the control group treated with NSAIDs.  In preliminary studies, methotrexate appears to have significant benefit in children who have failed other treatments.  Other newer therapies, such as intravenous gammaglobulin, have only been used in a small number of patients and have not as yet been proven beneficial.",19
"Left ventricular dilatation and pulmonary thallium uptake after single-photon emission computer tomography using thallium-201 during adenosine-induced coronary hyperemia.  This study examined the implications of left ventricular (LV) dilatation and increased pulmonary thallium uptake during adenosine-induced coronary hyperemia.  The lung-to-heart thallium ratio in the initial images was significantly higher in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) than normal subjects; 0.48 +/- 0.16 in 3-vessel disease (n = 16), 0.43 +/- 0.10 in 2-vessel disease (n = 20), 0.43 +/- 0.08 in 1-vessel disease (n = 16) and 0.36 +/- 0.05 in normal subjects (n = 7) (p less than 0.001, 0.09 and 0.06, respectively).  There was a significant correlation between the severity and the extent of the perfusion abnormality (determined from the polar maps) and the lung-to-heart thallium ratio (r = 0.51 and 0.52, respectively, p less than 0.0002).  There was also a significant correlation between lung thallium washout and lung-to-heart thallium ratio (r = 0.42, p = 0.0009) and peak heart rate (r = -0.49, p less than 0.0001).  The LV dilatation was mostly due to an increase in cavity dimension (30% increase) and to a lesser extent (6% increase) due to increase in LV size.  (The cavity dimensions were measured from the short-axis slices at the midventricular level in the initial and delayed images).  The dilation was seen in patients with CAD but not in the normal subjects.  These changes correlated with the extent and severity of the thallium perfusion abnormality.  Thus, adenosine-induced coronary hyperemia may cause LV dilation and increased lung thallium uptake on the basis of subendocardial ischemia.",13
The effect of rifampicin on rhinoscleroma: an electron microscopic study.  Twenty-five cases suffering from rhinoscleroma were divided into two groups.  The first group consisted of 15 patients treated with rifampicin systemically.  The other group consisted of 10 patients treated locally with rifampicin in the form of ointment.  Electron microscopic study of the pathological changes in the lesions showed that rifampicin is highly effective both systemically and locally in the treatment of rhinoscleroma.,7
"Graves' ophthalmopathy. Correlation of saccadic eye movements with age, presence of optic neuropathy, and extraocular muscle volume.  Quantitative infrared oculography was used to record saccadic eye movements of 49 patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy.  Peak saccadic velocities were decreased in those patients who developed or presented with optic neuropathy.  This effect was more pronounced for larger eye movements.  Peak saccadic velocity also decreased as total extraocular muscle volume and limitation of ocular motility increased.  For any given extraocular muscle volume, peak saccadic velocity was 40 degrees/s slower in patients 40 years or older than in younger patients.  The relationship between velocity and motility limitation was most pronounced for intermediate muscle volumes (8% to 15% of total orbital volume).  Saccadic velocities in those patients with optic nerve compression often improved following treatment.  This study demonstrated that eye movement recording was a useful adjunct in evaluation of patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy.  Furthermore, age-related lowering of peak saccadic velocities implicated changes of extraocular muscle structure as a factor in the development of optic neuropathy.",10
"The Senior Care Study. The optimal use of medications in acutely ill older patients.  Geriatric assessment units have improved pharmacotherapy for their patients by decreasing the number of medications prescribed.  The Senior Care Study, a randomized controlled trial, compared a multidisciplinary-team approach to patient care to the standard medical practice of the institution.  As a part of the trial, the effectiveness of an interdisciplinary team intervention in improving the use of medications was studied.  Study goals were to decrease medications used, decrease unnecessary medications, and improve medication choices in our acutely ill inpatient population.  A pharmacist interviewed all experimental patients and patient records, and presented medication concerns and recommendations at a team conference.  Medications were counted on admission and on the third day, sixth week, and third month after randomization.  Medications were paired with patient problems.  Medication:problem pairs were judged as inappropriate choices if there were potential side effects that would affect patient function, and if better alternatives were available.  The 215 control and 221 experimental patients in the study were similar in age, sex, place of origin, and number of medications on admission.  Experimental patients took fewer medications than controls on the third day (5.3 versus 5.9, P less than .05).  Experimental patients received fewer multiple unpaired medications (11% versus 19%, P less than .025) and fewer inappropriate medication choices (20% versus 37%, P less than .005).  The results suggest that the team intervention was effective in improving pharmacotherapy in the acute-care setting.",22
"Anteromedial tibial tubercle transfer without bone graft.  We followed 30 patients for more than 2 years after anteromedial tibial tubercle transfer for persistent patellofemoral pain associated with patellar articular degeneration.  Twelve of these patients were followed more than 5 years.  We report 93% good and excellent results subjectively and 89% good and excellent results objectively.  The quality of improvement was sustained in all 12 of the patients who were evaluated again after more than 5 years from surgery.  When examined separately, 75% of those patients with advanced patellar arthrosis achieved a good result; none of these patients achieved an excellent result.  Postoperative continuous passive motion has markedly reduced the incidence of stiffness.  Serious complications such as compartment syndrome, infection, and skin slough were avoided completely in 51 consecutive cases.  Patellofemoral contact pressure studies in five cadaver knees have shown that anteromedial tibial tubercle transfer can provide substantial reduction of patellofemoral contact stress while helping to balance medial and lateral facet pressures.  This surgical procedure is mechanically and clinically successful for alleviating intractable pain related to patellar malalignment and articular degeneration.  This procedure enables the majority of appropriately selected patients with malalignment and patellar articular degeneration to resume increased levels of activity with substantially diminished pain.",9
"Comparison of medical and surgical therapy for uncomplicated descending aortic dissection.  To guide the choice of medical versus surgical therapy for patients with descending (type B) aortic dissection (tear in the descending aorta without involvement of the ascending aorta), multivariate survival analysis was applied to 136 patients admitted to two medical centers between 1975 and 1988 with acute (n = 89) or chronic (n = 47) descending dissection: group 1, all 136 patients; group 2, 106 patients without rupture, pulse loss, or visceral organ compromise; and group 3, 56 patients from group 2 without major cardiac or renal disease (23 surgical and 33 medical).  Group 3 medical and surgical subgroups were well matched for baseline characteristics and were potential candidates for either mode of therapy.  By Cox model analysis, significant predictors of mortality were pleural rupture, other dissection complications, increasing age, and cardiac disease (all p less than 0.01).  Surgical versus medical therapy was not an independent determinant of survival in any of the three groups for acute or chronic dissection.  Survival probabilities for all group 3 patients at 1, 5, and 10 years were 0.94, 0.87, and 0.32 (medical) and 0.90, 0.80, and 0.50 (surgical).  Despite the limitations of this retrospective study (including the possibility of undefined treatment selection biases), these data suggest that medical or early surgical therapy is associated with equivalent outcome in selected patients with uncomplicated acute or chronic descending aortic dissection.",13
"Comparison of i.m. ketorolac trometamol and morphine sulphate for pain relief after cholecystectomy.  I.m.  ketorolac trometamol 30 mg was compared with morphine sulphate 10 mg after cholecystectomy in a double-blind, multiple dose, randomized study of 100 patients.  Assessments of pain were made immediately after operation (day 1), and the next morning (day 2).  Pain intensity (verbal response score and visual analogue scale) was recorded before injection and then over a 6-h period.  Pain relief was assessed also.  The effect of ketorolac on operative blood loss and platelet function was examined.  Time to commencing oral intake and the duration of administration of i.v.  fluids were recorded.  Adverse events were noted.  Ketorolac produced significantly less analgesia than morphine on day 1, but on day 2 the two drugs produced a similar effect.  Blood loss was not increased by ketorolac, although platelet function was impaired.  Repeated i.m.  administration of ketorolac did not produce any serious adverse effects.",22
"Protein differences between normal and oligospermic human sperm demonstrated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.  Protein expression by sperm obtained from men with normal semen analysis and men with oligospermia were evaluated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.  Proteins were solubilized in a 9.5 M urea/2% Nonidet-P40 (LKB, Bromma, Sweden) lysis buffer and underwent second dimension separation on 10 to 16% polyacrylamide gradient gels.  A set of 36 invariant proteins was identified in all normospermic samples, whereas 8 of 10 evaluable oligospermic samples lacked 1 or more of the invariant proteins.  Proteins absent in oligospermic samples may be critical to normal sperm function and may serve as markers for infertility.",11
"Learning curve for radial keratotomy.  I prospectively evaluated my own learning curve for radial keratotomy (RK) by comparing the results achieved in two groups: 20 consecutive eyes on which I performed RK without having had previous experience with the procedure (group 1); and 20 other eyes, matched for age, sex, and preoperative refractive error, on which I performed RK after I had performed the procedure 250 times (group 2).  Although there were nine microperforations in group 1 and none in group 2, the postoperative refractions and uncorrected visual acuities were similar in both groups.  Since the microperforations had no adverse effect on the visual results, it is reasonable to conclude that there was, in effect, no learning curve involved in my experience with RK.",10
"Multisurface method of pattern separation for medical diagnosis applied to breast cytology.  Multisurface pattern separation is a mathematical method for distinguishing between elements of two pattern sets.  Each element of the pattern sets is comprised of various scalar observations.  In this paper, we use the diagnosis of breast cytology to demonstrate the applicability of this method to medical diagnosis and decision making.  Each of 11 cytological characteristics of breast fine-needle aspirates reported to differ between benign and malignant samples was graded 1 to 10 at the time of sample collection.  Nine characteristics were found to differ significantly between benign and malignant samples.  Mathematically, these values for each sample were represented by a point in a nine-dimensional space of real variables.  Benign points were separated from malignant ones by planes determined by linear programming.  Correct separation was accomplished in 369 of 370 samples (201 benign and 169 malignant).  In the one misclassified malignant case, the fine-needle aspirate cytology was so definitely benign and the cytology of the excised cancer so definitely malignant that we believe the tumor was missed on aspiration.  Our mathematical method is applicable to other medical diagnostic and decision-making problems.",3
"Meropenem pharmacokinetics and penetration into an inflammatory exudate.  The pharmacokinetics and penetration into a cantharidine-induced inflammatory exudate of meropenem was studied in six volunteers following a single 1-g intravenous dose.  Concentrations in plasma, urine, and the inflammatory exudate were determined by a microbiological assay.  The mean elimination half-life of meropenem in plasma was 1.1 h, with the concentration in plasma declining from a mean of 23.6 micrograms/ml at 1 h to 0.7 micrograms/ml at 6 h.  The inflammatory fluid penetration was rapid (time to maximum concentration of drug in serum, 0.75 h), and the penetration was 111%.  The recovery of meropenem in urine at 24 h was 65.4% of the administered dose.",22
"A placebo-controlled trial of immunotherapy with two extracts of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus in allergic rhinitis, comparing clinical outcome with changes in antigen-specific IgE, IgG, and IgG subclasses.  A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of immunotherapy was conducted in patients with Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus rhinitis.  Thirty patients received an extract with a high content of Der p I (Pharmalgen), 20 received a conventional mite extract (Allpyral), and 30 patients received histamine chloride (placebo).  Specific IgG and subclasses were measured before and after 3 and 12 months of treatment by RIA and/or ELISA, and specific IgE by RAST.  Clinical outcome was assessed by skin prick tests, nasal challenge, visual analogue, and diary-card symptom and drug scores; from these findings, a clinical index was derived.  An IgG response occurred only in the Pharmalgen-treated group: D.  pter IgG and IgG1 increased by 3 months (p less than 0.05) and then plateaued to 12 months (p less than 0.05).  IgG4 levels increased throughout treatment (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01), as did the IgG/IgE ratio.  A subclass switch from IgG1 to IgG4 occurred.  D.  pter IgE rose at 3 months (p less than 0.05).  Clinical improvement occurred at 3 and 12 months in the Pharmalgen-treated group only.  Pretreatment levels of IgE, IgG1, or IgG4 did not predict clinical outcome.  Our findings are compatible with the hypothesis that IgG subclasses may modulate antigen-IgE interactions, although the antibody response to this potent extract need not be causally related to improvement.",7
"Comparison of coronary angiography and early oral dipyridamole thallium-201 scintigraphy in patients receiving thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction.  We evaluated 50 consecutive patients who received thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction using thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography in combination with oral dipyridamole (300 mg) to assess the frequency of residual myocardial ischemia.  Thallium studies were performed early after myocardial infarction at a mean of 4.6 days (range 3 to 11) in 50 patients.  The time from the onset of chest pain to the administration of thrombolytic therapy was 2.6 hours (range 0.5 to 5.5).  Q wave myocardial infarction was evident in 46 patients; four patients had a non-Q wave infarction (anterior infarction in 31 patients and inferior infarction in 19 patients).  The serum mean peak creatinine kinase was 1503 IU/L (range 127 to 6500).  Coronary angiography was performed in all patients at a mean of 3.1 days (range 2 to 10) and revealed the infarct-related vessel to be patent in 36 patients (72%).  The ejection fraction was 48% (range 26% to 67%).  After dipyridamole administration, 13 patients (26%) developed angina that was easily reversed with the administration of intravenous aminophylline.  Systolic blood pressure decreased from 122 to 115 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and the heart rate increased from 76 to 85 beats/min (p less than 0.05).  None of the patients had significant hypotension, arrhythmias, or evidence of infarct extension.  Perfusion abnormalities were present on the initial thallium images in 48 patients.  Redistribution suggestive of ischemia was present in 36 patients (72%).  Ischemia confined to the vascular distribution of the infarct vessel was evident in 22 patients.  Seven patients had ischemia in the infarct zone as well as in a remote myocardial segment.  Thus 29 patients (58%) had ischemia in the distribution of the infarct vessel.  Ischemia in the infarct zone was evident in 19 of 36 patients (53%) with open infarct vessels and in 10 of 14 patients (71%) with occluded infarct vessels.  In conclusion, thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography using oral dipyridamole was safely performed in patients with recent myocardial infarctions who receive thrombolytic therapy.",13
"In vivo immune selection of a Moloney murine leukemia virus-induced tumor results in the loss of viral- but not tumor-associated antigens.  A protocol of in vivo immune selection has been used to isolate a variant of the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV)-induced tumor MBL-2.  Characterization of the tumor variant indicated that selection resulted in the isolation of a cell which is incapable of producing infectious virus and no longer capable of synthesizing viral proteins.  Although the failure to express viral Ag has rendered the variant tumor cells resistant to lysis by CTL specific for MuLV viral Ag, the variant tumor cells retained their susceptibility to lysis by CTL which appear to be directed against an MuLV-induced tumor-associated Ag.  The data indicate that the expression of nonviral tumor-associated Ag by MBL-2 is not dependent upon continued viral gene expression.",19
"Prospective trial comparing a combination pH probe-nasogastric tube with aspirated gastric pH in intensive care unit patients.  Upper GI bleeding related to stress ulcer syndrome is estimated to affect as much as 15% of patients in an ICU.  Since the occurrence of bleeding after ICU admission may be associated with increased morbidity and mortality, many efforts have been directed at defining optimal therapy for stress ulcer prophylaxis.  Titration of intragastric pH with antacids or iv doses of H2-receptor antagonists may prevent stress ulcer bleeding in high-risk ICU patients.  We evaluated a recently developed pH probe incorporated into an NG tube and compared it with aspiration of gastric contents using pH paper as a means to monitor pH in 22 surgical ICU patients.  Regression analysis comparing the intragastric probe pH values with the aspirated pH values showed a good correlation between the two methods (r = .71).  This new technique for intragastric pH measurement appears technically simple and clinically applicable for use on patients at risk for stress ulcer bleeding.  It may be more accurate than pH paper in patients receiving antacids.",5
"Activated eosinophils increase vascular permeability and resistance in isolated perfused rat lungs   The effects of eosinophils activated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) on isolated perfused rat lungs were examined.  Eosinophils were obtained from lungs of rats infected with Toxocara canis by bronchoalveolar lavage, incubated with PMA, and administered to an isolated perfused rat lung preparation.  Vascular endothelial permeability was assessed by measuring the capillary filtration coefficient (Kf,c) in the perfused lungs.  In lungs receiving either no eosinophils (control) or nonactivated eosinophils, there were no changes in pulmonary hemodynamics or Kf,c.  However, in lungs receiving 2 x 10(6) eosinophils activated with PMA, there was a transient 4.8-fold increase in pulmonary vascular resistance that peaked at 30 min, primarily due to the constriction of small arteries and veins.  After the initial pressor response, Kf,c was increased to 7.5 times control at 130 min and resulted in marked lung edema, increased wet-dry weight ratios, and edema on histologic examination.  Pulmonary arterial pressure and Kf,c responses were dose related for eosinophil numbers between 1 x 10(6) and 4 x 10(6) cells.  Peak airway pressure (Paw) during constant tidal volume ventilation also increased in lungs receiving activated eosinophils compared to the control and nonactivated eosinophil groups.  These findings indicate that activated eosinophils are potent effector cells and can cause pulmonary vasoconstriction, bronchoconstriction, and vascular endothelial injury without widespread plugging of capillaries by aggregated eosinophils.",2
Evaluation of the stimulated menstrual cycle by magnetic resonance imaging.  Changes in uterine zonal anatomy in six women during a cycle of treatment with clomiphene citrate is studied by magnetic resonance imaging.  There was a rapid rate of increase in endometrial thickness during the periovulatory period that was similar to the pattern seen in a prior study of women with normal (nonstimulated) cycles.  Junctional zone thickness did not parallel the endometrial pattern and differed from the response seen in nonstimulated cycles.  Results of large scale studies may help to further understand the effects of these medications.,12
"Frequency of indeterminate western blot tests in healthy adults at low risk for human immunodeficiency virus infection. The NIAID AIDS Vaccine Clinical Trails Network.  As part of a phase 1 trial of a candidate AIDS vaccine, blood specimens were collected from 168 healthy adult volunteers at minimal or no risk for becoming infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).  These specimens were screened for evidence of HIV-1 infection by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and the Biotech/Du Pont Western blot (n = 168), culture (n = 122), and polymerase chain reaction assay (n = 20).  None of the subjects had a positive test result by any of these assays, but 32% had indeterminate Western blot tests, most of which demonstrated a single band of low intensity.  The most common bands were p24 (47%), p55 (34%), and p66 (36%); envelope bands were unusual (gp41, 2%; gp120, 2%).  No serum specimen collected after 2-11 months from individuals with indeterminate Western blot results was positive by EIA or Western blot.  There was 91% agreement in the test results of the first and second serum samples when the same lot of Western blot kit was used but only 36% agreement when different lots were used.  The Biotech/Du Pont Western blot kit thus frequently yields indeterminate test results in the absence of HIV-1 infection, the reproducibility of which is subject to lot-to-lot variability.",19
The management of posterior urethral valves by initial vesicostomy and delayed valve ablation.  We managed 32 neonates and infants with temporary vesicostomy and delayed valve ablation.  The criterion on which successful management was gauged was estimated creatinine clearance.  Renal failure or death occurred in 30% of the patients and 7% required transplantation.  There was no apparent difference between our patients managed initially with vesicostomy and other series managed initially with valve ablation in preventing the complications of posterior urethral valves.,11
"Spontaneous rheumatoid-like arthritis in a line of mice sensitive to collagen-induced arthritis.  Twenty-eight percent of 13-month-old male mice of the high antibody responder line of Biozzi's selection I (HI) spontaneously developed a long-lasting inflammatory arthritis.  This disease was clinically and histologically similar to human rheumatoid arthritis.  The synovium of joints and some tendons was hypertrophied, with thickening of the synovial cell layer and infiltration by polymorphonuclear and mononuclear leukocytes.  In some cases, synovial pannus formation led to destructive damage of articular cartilage and bone.  Rheumatoid factor and antinuclear, anti-DNA, and anti-type II collagen (CII) antibodies were often found in the sera of both arthritic mice and clinically normal littermates.  The presence of CII autoantibodies in this line of mice suggests that a potentially harmful anti-CII T cell autoimmunity can also develop spontaneously and lead to joint damage.  Moreover, HI mice are also susceptible to collagen-induced arthritis, while a closely related mouse line (HII) is resistant to both diseases.  These data support the hypothesis that collagen-induced arthritis is pathogenetically related both to this spontaneous arthritis and to rheumatoid arthritis.",16
"Intra-osseous pressure and oxygen tension in avascular necrosis and osteoarthritis of the hip.  The intra-osseous pressure, PO2, and PCO2 were measured in 32 hips (21 patients) which were painful but showed no severe degenerative changes.  Pre-operative scintigraphy and radiography was performed in all patients.  Thirteen hips showed early osteoarthritis, eight had early osteonecrosis, and 11 had no changes.  Core biopsies were performed and the bone was examined histologically and graded for necrosis.  Histologically, necrosis was present in 27 specimens.  Scintigraphic findings did not correlate with the histological results but were more closely related to the radiographic findings.  The intra-osseous pressure in hips with histological necrosis (mean 47 mmHg) was significantly higher than in hips without necrosis (mean 26 mmHg).  The PO2 was lower in bone with histological necrosis (mean 44 mmHg) than in bone without (mean 71 mmHg).  PO2 increased and intra-osseous pressure decreased after decompression.  The results confirm that ischaemia plays a central role in the development of necrotic changes in bone.  Histological necrosis was found in hips with radiographic signs of osteonecrosis and in those with osteoarthritis.  Radiography, and scintigraphy are shown to be insensitive methods for differentiating between those disorders.",4
"Clinical and laboratory effects of prolonged therapy with sulfasalazine, gold or penicillamine: the effects of disease duration on treatment response.  Serial observations for up to 5 years of clinical score (a subjective global assessment), serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were analyzed in 3 groups of patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) requiring treatment with a second line drug.  The groups comprised 315 patients (243 women, 72 men) who had sulfasalazine (SAS); 203 patients (141 women, 62 men) who had sodium aurothiomalate (gold) and 163 patients (131 women, 32 men) who had penicillamine.  The groups matched in most respects but the gold group had a smaller proportion of women, a shorter median disease duration and a higher median CRP than the remaining 2 groups.  The penicillamine group contained a higher proportion of seropositive patients.  In each group there were significant improvements in clinical score, CRP and ESR for all time points from 6 to 30 months; these improvements were maintained for longer (up to 60 months for SAS) in the SAS and gold groups but the differences between the drugs after 30 months were probably a consequence of falling number of patients, not differing drug potencies.  The mean ESR and CRP levels fell to about 30 mm/h and 20-30 mg/l, respectively.  Response was defined as (1) treatment duration greater than 6 months, (2) clinical score improvement greater than 4 by 6 months, (3) ESR fall to less than 30 mm/h by 6 months.  By these criteria 142 of 681 patients (20.9%) responded; the response rates were SAS 20.3%, gold 24.1%, penicillamine 17.8%.",16
"Insulinlike activity of new antidiabetic agent CP 68722 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.  We examined the in vitro effects of CP 68722, a novel antidiabetic agent, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.  CP 68722 stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake in the absence of insulin.  At least 30 min of incubation were required for stimulation of uptake.  This effect increased over 5 h and was sustained up to 72 h.  The stimulation of 2-deoxyglucose uptake by CP 68722 could be inhibited approximately 60% by inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide.  Half-maximal and maximal responses to CP 68722 at 72 h of incubation were observed at 10 and 100 microM of drug, respectively, with a threefold stimulation of uptake at 100 microM approximating the maximal response of these cells to acute insulin stimulation.  CP 68722 was able to overcome insulin resistance induced by dexamethasone in 3T3-L1 cells.  The effect of drug, like that of insulin, was primarily to increase the Vmax of 2-deoxyglucose uptake.  The stimulation of uptake by CP 68722 or insulin could be prevented by incubating the cells at 10 degrees C, a temperature that impedes translocation of glucose transporters to the plasma membrane.  Therefore, it appears that CP 68722, like insulin, stimulates glucose uptake by a mechanism that involves translocation of intracellular glucose transporters to the plasma membrane and de novo protein synthesis.  We compared the effect of CP 68722 with the sulfonylureas, the primary drugs used in the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).  CP 68722 was a more potent and effective stimulator of 2-deoxyglucose uptake in 3T3-L1 cells than either first- or second-generation sulfonylureas.",17
"The MAC scale in a normal population: the meaning of ""false positives"".  The MAC scale has been very successful in identifying alcoholics and, in studies of clinical populations, is often considered a test for predisposition to alcoholism.  MacAndrew, however, holds that the MAC scale assesses a more general personality trait characterized by sociability, boldness, rebelliousness and pleasure seeking.  The present study examines the distribution of MAC scale scores in a normal population and tests for correlates of high MAC scores other than alcohol-related problems (e.g., arrest history).  The sample consisted of 1,117 men, participants in the Normative Aging Study (mean age = 61.6).  As expected, heavier drinkers and problem drinkers reported significantly higher MAC scale scores than did lighter and nonproblem drinkers.  However, arrestees without drinking problems had MAC scale scores nearly identical to those of problem drinkers without arrest histories (23.19 and 23.42, respectively).  Further, 36% of the sample without problem drinking or arrest histories had MAC scale scores of 24 or above, the clinical indicator of alcoholism, and more than 32% of these had scores above 27.  In the entire sample, of the 152 men who had MAC scores above 27, 71% had no problems, either with arrest or drinking.  Results are interpreted as supporting MacAndrew's interpretation of the meaning of the MAC scale as a general personality measure rather than a specific alcoholism instrument.",20

"Vaccination against tumor cells expressing breast cancer epithelial tumor antigen.  Ninety-one percent of breast tumors aberrantly express an epithelial tumor antigen (ETA) identified by monoclonal antibody H23.  Vaccinia virus recombinants expressing tumor antigens have considerable promise in the active immunotherapy of cancer, and we have evaluated the potential of vaccinia recombinants expressing the secreted (S) and cell-associated (transmembrane, T) forms of H23 ETA to elicit immunity to tumor cells expressing ETA.  Tumorigenic ras-transformed Fischer rat fibroblast lines FR-S and FR-T, expressing the S or T form of H23 ETA, respectively, were constructed for use in challenge experiments.  Expression of H23 ETA in these lines was confirmed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence.  When challenged by subcutaneous seeding of tumor cells, 97% (FR-S) and 91% (FR-T) of syngeneic Fischer rats rapidly developed tumors that failed to regress.  Vaccination with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing ETA-T prior to challenge prevented tumor development in 82% of animals seeded with FR-T cells but in only 61% of animals seeded with FR-S.  The vaccinia recombinant expressing the S form was a less effective immunogen, and vaccination protected only 29-30% of animals from developing tumors upon challenge with either FR-S or -T cells.  The increased immunogenicity of the recombinant expressing ETA-T was reflected in elevated levels of ETA-reactive antibody in vaccinated animals, confirming that secreted antigens expressed from vaccinia virus are less effective immunogens than their membrane-associated counterparts.",3
"A randomized, prospective field trial of a conjugate vaccine in the protection of infants and young children against invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b disease   BACKGROUND.  Haemophilus influenzae type b is the leading cause of invasive bacterial disease in young children.  The capsular polysaccharide vaccine does not protect children at greatest risk (those under the age of 18 months), but a polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine has proved to be more immunogenic in this age group.  METHODS.  We enrolled 114,000 infants in Finland in an open, prospective, randomized trial of a H.  influenzae type b capsular polysaccharide-diphtheria toxoid conjugate vaccine (polyribosylribitol phosphate-diphtheria toxoid [PRP-D]).  Children born on odd-numbered days were vaccinated at the ages of 3, 4, 6, and 14 to 18 months; those born on even-numbered days formed the control group and received the same vaccine at the age of 24 months.  RESULTS.  After three doses of the vaccine there were 4 cases of verified bacteremic H.  influenzae type b disease in the group receiving early vaccination, as compared with 64 cases in the control group, between the ages of approximately 7 and 24 months.  The protective efficacy of the vaccine was thus 94 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 83 to 98).  No serious adverse effects were reported.  The immune response to the conjugate vaccine was characteristic of a T-cell-dependent response when studied in a cohort of 120 infants.  The primary immunization series resulted in a geometric mean concentration of anticapsular antibody of 0.53 micrograms per milliliter at the age of seven months, and the fourth dose evoked an anamnestic response, with a mean antibody concentration of 45.22 micrograms per milliliter.  CONCLUSIONS.  A new conjugate vaccine consisting of the capsular polysaccharide of H.  influenzae type b covalently linked to a protein carrier (PRP-D), administered to infants beginning at the age of 3 months, is highly effective in protecting young Finnish children (7 to 24 months old) against invasive H.  influenzae type b infections.",0
"Dacron fabric-enveloped hydroxyapatite prosthesis for sternal tumor defect: an autopsy report.  A 38-year-old housewife with solitary plasmacytoma of the manubrium who underwent a subtotal sternectomy treated by resection of the lesion is reported.  This was followed by replacement with a Dacron fabric-enveloped hydroxyapatite prosthesis.  The Dacron fabric was sutured to the surrounding tissues, and then the clavicle was passed through the cylindrical-shaped Dacron fabric to form a sternoclavicular joint capsule.  The patient returned to her daily life 3 months after the operation.  She had no trouble in her daily living, without any dislocation of the sternoclavicular joints or any displacement of the artificial sternum.  The autopsy examination about 1 year after the operation showed that the Dacron fabric enveloping the artificial sternum became stronger with time.  The sternoclavicular joint also was stably fixed, and the Dacron fabric fulfilled its function as an artificial articular capsule and biologic fixation of the surrounding supporting tissues.",3
"Final report of the French multicenter phase II study of the nitrosourea fotemustine in 153 evaluable patients with disseminated malignant melanoma including patients with cerebral metastases.  One hundred sixty-nine patients with histologic evidence of disseminated malignant melanoma, including patients with cerebral metastases, were entered into a Phase II study of the nitrosourea fotemustine.  The treatment regimen consisted of a 100 mg/m2 1 hour IV infusion every week for 3 consecutive weeks, followed by a 4- to 5-week rest period (induction therapy).  In responding or stabilized patients, maintenance therapy consisted of 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks until the disease progressed.  One hundred fifty-three patients were evaluable for response.  Three complete responses and 34 partial responses were observed (according to the World Health Organization criteria), leading to an objective response rate of 24.2% (95% confidence interval: 17.4% to 31.0%).  Responses were also documented on cerebral (25.0%), visceral (19.2%), or nonvisceral (31.8%) metastatic sites.  The median duration of response was 22 weeks (range, 7 to 80 weeks).  The objective response rate in previously untreated patients was 30.7% (19 of 62 patients).  The main toxicity was hematologic with delayed and reversible leukopenia and/or thrombopenia.  The objective response rate observed (especially in untreated patients), the activity on cerebral metastases, and the small amount of extra-hematologic toxicity encountered suggest that fotemustine is an effective drug in disseminated malignant melanoma.",3
"Electrocardiographic signal-averaging during atrial pacing and effect of cycle length on the terminal QRS in patients with and without inducible ventricular tachycardia.  Electrocardiographic signal-averaging during sinus rhythm (61 to 99 beats/min) and atrial pacing (100 to 171 beats/min) were performed to determine the effect of heart rate on late potentials in 15 patients without (group 1) and 7 patients with (group 2) inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT).  In sinus rhythm (79 +/- 12 vs 77 +/- 12 beats/min, difference not significant), the duration of the low-amplitude signal less than 40 microV was longer in group 2 than group 1 (43 +/- 21 vs 26 +/- 8 ms, p = 0.034) and more patients had late potentials (57 vs 7%, p = 0.021), but QRS duration (121 +/- 32 vs 98 +/- 19 ms) and terminal voltage (33 +/- 33 vs 50 +/- 26 ms) were not significantly different.  With atrial pacing in group 1 (128 +/- 16 beats/min), 3 patients developed a simultaneous decrease in terminal voltage and an increase in terminal QRS duration consistent with a late potential, but mean total and terminal durations were unchanged.  Terminal voltage increased (50 +/- 26 to 59 +/- 40) but not significantly.  With atrial pacing in group 2 (119 +/- 12 beats/min) all patients either had a late potential or developed a simultaneous decrease in terminal voltage and an increase in terminal QRS duration (p = 0.001 vs group 1).  Root mean square (p = 0.001 vs group 1).  Root mean square voltage decreased (33 +/- 23 to 22 +/- 23) and became significantly different from group 1 (p = 0.017).  Mean QRS duration, root mean square terminal voltage and low-amplitude terminal QRS duration, however, were unchanged.",13
"The surprising kidney-fluid mechanism for pressure control--its infinite gain!  In this short paper, I have tried to explain the elation that we felt when we first realized that the kidney-fluid mechanism for controlling the arterial pressure has an infinite feedback gain property.  Because of this, all the other pressure control mechanisms, none of which has ever been shown to have a similar infinite gain property, must themselves alter the kidney-fluid mechanism if they are to succeed in causing long-term changes in the arterial pressure.  We have not been able to refute this principle despite many experiments over the last 2 decades.  For this reason, our first understanding of the infinite gain property of the kidney-fluid mechanism was like a light at the end of the tunnel.  I hope that I can explain to the reader the excitement of those few seconds when we first recognized the principle in 1966.",13
"Sodium-calcium interactions and salt-sensitive hypertension.  In humans with essential hypertension, salt-induced increases in blood pressure have been reported to correlate directly with salt-induced increases in intracellular free calcium [( Ca2+]i) in circulating mononuclear cells.  These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that salt-induced increases in [Ca2+]i mediate the phenomenon of salt sensitivity.  Circumstantial evidence suggests that salt-induced increases in intracellular sodium or in plasma levels of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D might mediate salt-induced increases in [Ca2+]i and blood pressure.  However, in humans with salt-sensitive hypertension, it remains to be determined: (1) whether salt-induced increases in white blood cell [Ca2+]i reflect corresponding increases in vascular smooth muscle [Ca2+]i; (2) whether salt-induced increases in [Ca2+]i are a cause or consequence of salt-induced increases in blood pressure; and (3) whether salt-induced increases in 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D or intracellular sodium precede salt-induced increases in [Ca2+]i.",13
"Relation between rectal sensation and anal function in normal subjects and patients with faecal incontinence.  The relation between sensory perception of rapid balloon distension of the rectum and the motor responses of the rectum and external and internal anal sphincters in 27 normal subjects and 16 patients with faecal incontinence who had impaired rectal sensation but normal sphincter pressures was studied.  In both patients and normal subjects, the onset and duration of rectal sensation correlated closely with the external anal sphincter electrical activity (r = 0.8, p less than 0.0001) and with rectal contraction (r = 0.51, p less than 0.001), but not with internal sphincter relaxation.  All normal subjects perceived a rectal sensation within one second of rapid inflation of a rectal balloon with volumes of 20 ml or less air.  Six patients did not perceive any rectal sensation until 60 ml had been introduced, while in the remaining nine patients the sensation was delayed by at least two seconds.  Internal sphincter relaxation occurred before the sensation was perceived in three of 27 normal subjects and 11 of 16 patients (p less than 0.001), and could be associated with anal leakage, which stopped as soon as sensation was perceived.  The lowest rectal volumes required to induce anal relaxation, to cause sustained relaxation, or to elicit sensations of a desire to defecate or pain were similar in patients and normal subjects.  In conclusion, these results show the close association between rectal sensation and external anal sphincter contraction, and show that faecal incontinence may occur as a result of delayed or absent external anal sphincter contraction when the internal anal sphincter is relaxed.",5
"Clinical and morphometric results of penetrating keratoplasty with one-piece anterior-chamber or suture-fixated posterior-chamber lenses in the absence of lens capsule.  The clinical records and serial corneal endothelial images of 25 acapsular, pseudophakic eyes with Kelman-style, one-piece, anterior-chamber intraocular lenses and 24 acapsular, pseudophakic eyes with suture-fixated, posterior-chamber intraocular lenses following penetrating keratoplasty were reviewed to determine clinical success and endothelial survival after 1 year.  Twenty-two (88%) of 25 grafts in the anterior-chamber intraocular lens group and 23 (96%) of 24 grafts in the sutured posterior-chamber intraocular lens group were clear after 1 year; best corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better was noted in 25% of the eyes in the anterior-chamber intraocular lens group and 29% of the eyes in the sutured posterior-chamber intraocular lens group.  The mean intraocular pressure for the anterior-chamber intraocular lens group was significantly lower than for the sutured posterior-chamber intraocular lens group at 3 months (17 +/- 4 vs 21 +/- 7 mm Hg) and at 6 months (17 +/- 3 vs 20 +/- 5 mm Hg); but did not differ at 1 year.  The mean percent of endothelial cell loss after 1 year did not differ between the anterior-chamber intraocular lens group (32% +/- 26%) and the sutured posterior-chamber intraocular lens group (27% +/- 26%).  No clinical or endothelial morphometric advantages were noted after 1 year for the suture-fixated, posterior-chamber intraocular lens over the Kelman-style, one-piece anterior chamber, intraocular lens following pseudophakic penetrating keratoplasty; however, a long-term, prospective, randomized study of these two intraocular lens types is recommended.",10
"Alcohol and trauma.  Countermeasures to alcohol-related trauma are essential.  The public perception that there is low risk of detection and punishment for alcohol-precipitated violence is being addressed.  Current legislation is aimed at decreasing the availability of alcohol (e.g., adjusting legal drinking age, decreasing the serum alcohol intoxication limit, restricting the sale of alcoholic beverages at public events), increasing detection (e.g., greater driver surveillance, increased number of dedicated personnel), strengthening legal penalties for alcohol-related offenses, and mandating rehabilitative therapy.  Physicians can intervene in the alcohol-trauma cycle.  Unfortunately, they are notably poor in detecting the patient with alcohol-related injury.  Moreover, physicians infrequently refer these patients to facilities and personnel that are expert in alcohol detoxification and rehabilitation.  Recidivism can be positively impacted by physicians who are sensitive to and versed in the medical and social patterns of alcohol abuse.",20
"Detection of duodenal gastrinomas by operative endoscopic transillumination. A prospective study.  The ability of operative endoscopic transillumination of the bowel wall to detect duodenal gastrinoma was evaluated prospectively in 26 patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.  The results were assessed by exploratory laparotomy and compared with the results of other localization techniques.  Twelve duodenal gastrinomas were resected from 10 patients.  Operative endoscopic transillumination detected 10 of the 12 gastrinomas, a sensitivity of 83%, which was significantly greater (P less than 0.05) than that for either preoperative imaging (25%) or intraoperative ultrasonography and palpation (42%).  The sensitivity of operative endoscopic transillumination was a result of the ability to detect focal areas that did not transilluminate on the serosal side of the duodenum, and not the mucosal appearances seen through the endoscope, which were not helpful.  Operative endoscopic transillumination detected gastrinomas less than 1 cm in diameter throughout the duodenum.  Of the patients in this study, 39% had duodenal gastrinomas, a greater frequency than previously reported.  These results indicate that operative endoscopic transillumination is the most sensitive technique yet described for detecting duodenal gastrinomas and should be performed routinely in all patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome who undergo exploratory laparotomy for cure.",3
"Underestimation of treatment effect in crossover trials.  In crossover trials each subject serves as his own control.  For the study of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and angina pectoria, properly designed crossover studies are preferred to parallel studies.  There is a considerable between-subject variability of symptoms in some of these conditions.  Bias due to this is eliminated by the use of a crossover design.  However, a problem is the so-called treatment-by-period interaction.  The present study analyzes the potential influences of this on the outcome of the trial.  Physical carryover effect, defined as a physical effect of the first treatment period carrying on into the second, tends to minimize differences between two consecutive treatment periods.  So does the frustrating experience of an inactive agent in the first treatment period.  Outside influences such as the change of the seasons may affect lengthy crossover trials in a similar way.  The author concludes that the treatment effect in a crossover trial tends to be underestimated.  The current concept that reports of clinical trials are generally biased toward an exaggeration of treatment effects does not seem to apply to crossover trials.",13
"Segregation analysis of breast cancer from the cancer and steroid hormone study: histologic subtypes   The segregation pattern of breast cancer in white families from the Cancer and Steroid Hormone Study was investigated.  Families were categorized into four groups based on the histologic type of breast cancer in the probands:ductal cancer, lobular cancer, adenocarcinoma, and medullary cancer.  The ductal cancer sample was further split into a premenopausal-proband and a postmenopausal-proband subset.  Results for six complex segregation analyses are presented; the findings suggest heterogeneity in the transmission of breast cancer.  For all analyses, there was no evidence for a multifactorial component in the mixed model, ie, a major locus plus other transmission, genetic and/or cultural.  Interpretation of the medullary cancer, adenocarcinoma, and lobular cancer analyses does not permit discrimination among the major locus models.  Segregation of breast cancer in the entire ductal sample was consistent with autosomal recessive transmission.  In the ductal subanalyses, a recessive gene was sufficient to explain the breast cancer distribution when the proband had postmenopausal breast cancer.  In contrast, when the proband had premenopausal breast cancer, the transmission model was consistent with a dominant major gene, with sporadic cases of disease.",3
"Effects of 4-methylpyrazole, methanol/ethylene glycol antidote, in healthy humans.  4-Methylpyrazole (4-MP), an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase, may be useful for the treatment of methanol and ethylene glycol intoxications.  A placebo-controlled, double blind, multiple dose, sequential, ascending-dose study has been performed to determine the tolerance of 4-MP in healthy volunteers.  Oral loading doses of 4-MP were followed by supplemental doses every 12 h through 5 days, producing plasma levels in the therapeutic range.  A slight, transient elevation in one or both serum transaminase values was observed in 6 of the 15 subjects treated with 4-MP.  This effect was not dose related nor apparently mediated through a hypersensitivity reaction.  Serum triglyceride levels were increased in 30% of 4-MP treated subjects, but also in 25% of the placebo subjects.  4-MP treatment did not produce any other significant changes in objective clinical parameters nor in subjective side effects.  The results suggest that a mild, transient increase in liver function tests might be observed in some subjects treated with multiple doses of 4-MP.  Nevertheless, the slower elimination rate and lesser degree of toxicity of 4-MP would make it preferable to ethanol in therapy of these poisonings.",20
"Increased fatigue of isovelocity vs. isometric contractions of canine diaphragm.  A comparison of fatigue as a loss of force with repeated contractions over time was performed in canine respiratory muscle by isometric (nonshortening) and isovelocity (shortening) contractions.  In situ diaphragm muscle strips were attached to a linear ergometer and electrically stimulated (30 or 40 Hz) via the left phrenic nerve to produce either isometric (n = 12) or isovelocity (n = 12) contractions (1.5 s) from optimal muscle length (Lo = 8.8 cm).  Similar velocities of shortening between isovelocity experiments [0.19 +/- 0.02 (SD) Lo/S] were produced by maximizing the mean power output (Wmax = 210 +/- 27 mW/cm2) that could be developed over 1.5 s when displacement was approximately 0.30 Lo.  Initial peak isometric tension was 1.98 kg/cm2, whereas initial peak isovelocity tension was 1.84 kg/mc2 (P less than 0.01) or 93% of initial isometric tension.  Fatigue trials of 5 min were conducted on muscles contracting at a constant duty cycle (0.43).  At the end of the trials, peak isovelocity tension had fallen to 50% of initial isometric tension (P less than 0.01), whereas peak isometric tension had only fallen by 27%.  These results indicate that muscle shortening during force production has a significant influence on diaphragm muscle fatigue.  We conclude that the effects of shortening on fatigue must be considered in models of respiratory muscle function, because these muscles typically shorten during breathing.",22
"Effect of different rates of infusion of propofol for induction of anaesthesia in elderly patients.  The effect of changing the rate of infusion of propofol for induction of anaesthesia was studied in 60 elderly patients.  Propofol was administered at 300, 600 or 1200 ml h-1 until loss of consciousness (as judged by loss of verbal contact with the patient) had been achieved.  The duration of induction was significantly longer (P less than 0.001) with the slower infusion rates (104, 68 and 51 s), but the total dose used was significantly less (P less than 0.001) in these patients (1.2, 1.6 and 2.5 mg kg-1, respectively).  The decrease in systolic and diastolic arterial pressure was significantly less in the 300-ml h-1 group at the end of induction and immediately after induction (P less than 0.01).  The incidence of apnoea was also significantly less in the slower infusion group.",7
"Comparison of omeprazole and cimetidine in reflux oesophagitis: symptomatic, endoscopic, and histological evaluations.  Symptomatic patients with endoscopically verified reflux oesophagitis were randomised to a double blind trial in which they received either omeprazole (20 mg once daily) or cimetidine (400 mg four times daily) for four, and if necessary, eight weeks.  In an 'intention to treat' analysis, oesophagitis was found to have healed after four weeks in 77 of 137 (56%) in the omeprazole group and in 34 of 133 (26%) in the cimetidine group (p less than 0.001).  By eight weeks these values were 71% and 35% respectively; p less than 0.001.  Histological assessments were available for 73% of the patients.  At entry, 63% (66 of 104) in the omeprazole group and 60% (56 of 94) in the cimetidine group (ns) had abnormal histology.  After the study, the proportions of patients who initially had had abnormal histology but who then progressed to normal were 67% (44 of 66: omeprazole) and 48% (27 of 56: cimetidine) respectively (p less than 0.001).  All patients had reflux symptoms at entry.  After four weeks, 46% in the omeprazole group and 22% (p less than 0.001) in the cimetidine group were asymptomatic.  Diary cards completed for the first two weeks showed that patients treated with omeprazole experienced fewer reflux symptoms by day and night and used fewer antacids.  Omeprazole, 20 mg once a day for four to eight weeks, healed a greater proportion of patients with reflux oesophagitis than cimetidine, 1.6 g per day, assessed endoscopically and histologically, and relieved more patients' symptoms.",5
"Treatment of outflow tract obstruction due to benign prostatic hyperplasia with the pollen extract, cernilton. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study.  Whilst prostatectomy remains the ""gold standard"" for the treatment of outflow tract obstruction due to benign prostatic hyperplasia, medical treatment--if only for symptomatic relief--appears to be an attractive alternative.  Most of the pharmacological agents in use block the hormonal or the sympathetic neurological pathways that influence prostate growth and function.  All of these drugs are known to have side effects.  Sixty patients with outflow obstruction due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) were entered into a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effect of a 6-month course of the pollen extract, Cernilton.  There was a statistically significant subjective improvement with Cernilton (69% of the patients) compared with placebo (30%).  There was a significant decrease in residual urine in the patients treated with Cernilton and in the antero-posterior (A-P) diameter of the prostate on ultrasound.  However, differences in respect of flow rate and voided volume were not statistically significant.  It is concluded that Cernilton has a beneficial effect in BPH and may have a place in the treatment of patients with mild or moderate symptoms of outflow obstruction.",11
"The association between Type A behavior and change in coronary risk factors among young adults.  The association of Type A/B behavior pattern and changes in blood pressure, total serum cholesterol, serum triglyceride, body mass, and smoking was estimated in a cohort of 375 young Black and White men and women from a rural county in Central Kentucky between 1978-79 and 1985-88.  Type A participants experienced significant increases in systolic (2.90 +/- 1.29 mmHg) and diastolic (3.80 +/- 1.17 mmHg) blood pressure and in cigarette smoking (3.26 +/- 0.89 cigarettes per day) over the eight-year follow-up period, but Type B participants experienced no change.  Type A and B individuals showed similar changes in total serum cholesterol, serum triglyceride, or body mass.  Differences between behavioral types in blood pressure were present for women but not men, and for Blacks but not for Whites.  These findings suggest a possible significance of the Type A pattern for the development of cardiovascular risk of young adults.",13
"Campylobacter pylori interactions with gastric cell tissue culture.  Many investigators have reported that gastric mucosal biopsies of patients with chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer disease show the presence of Campylobacter pylori in a large majority of cases.  Histologic examinations of such tissues indicate a close approximation of C.  pylori with gastric surface epithelial cells.  A recent report has described both adherence and cell invasion of gastric cells by C.  pylori.  Using a transmission electron microscope, we have examined the interaction between C.  pylori, C.  jejuni, and E.  coli in vitro with a gastric cancer cell line, Kato III.  Our results indicate marked toxicity of E.  coli and moderate toxicity of C.  jejuni for Kato III cells.  C.  pylori had only a minor effect on tissue culture viability.  C.  pylori was found to have a strong association with the Kato III cell membranes and evidence of occasional cell invasion.  Both C.  jejuni and E.  coli showed no attachment or association with the Kato III cells.  We interpret these findings as indicating that C.  pylori may have a specific adhesion for gastric cells.",3
"Intercellular propagation of individually programmed growth bursts in FRTL-5 cells. Implications for interpreting growth factor actions.  Five methods are commonly used to quantify FRTL-5 cells' and other thyrocytes' growth in vitro and the impact of growth inhibiting or stimulating maneuvers: Total cell count, mitotic index, DNA measurement, total [3H]thymidine incorporation, and the fraction of [3H]thymidine labeled cells.  All of them assess cell growth as though all cells were homogeneous with an identical response to growth factors.  We demonstrate here that this assumption is not valid.  Rather, some intrinsically growth-prone cells appear to pass a growth signal to neighboring cells so that variably sized colonies of synchronized cells within each cluster growing from monodispersed cells are formed.  This is true for FRTL-5 cells growing in vitro in monolayers and in three-dimensional, collagen embedded spheroids.  The pattern is the same when cell suspensions or collagen-embedded spheroids are implanted onto nude mice.  Patches with alternating high and low growth become particularly prominent in the large tumor-like organoids grown from monodispersed cells in nude mice.  The pattern much reminds of similar observations in growing intact thyroids.  Since there is no significant correlation between the fraction of [3H]thymidine labeled cells and the size of two- or three-dimensional clusters in any experiment, growth of signal-spreading cells is assumed to occur in leaps and bounds.  Growth velocity in each subclone of a cell population depends on the mean interval between bursts of replications and on the number of cells synchronized by cell-to-cell diffusion of the growth signal emanating from one dividing cell.  Thus, growth-promoting and growth-inhibiting factors may not only act on the mean interval between successive growth bursts, but they may also change cell-to-cell spreading of growth signals.",18
"Efficacy and safety of vagus nerve stimulation in patients with complex partial seizures.  A clinical trial of chronic intermittent vagal stimulation in five patients suggests that the procedure may be safe and effective as adjunctive treatment of medically intractable seizures of partial onset.  Patients tolerated well the implantation of the neurocybernetic prosthesis and the vagal stimulation without serious physiological or lifestyle changes.  Stimulation of the vagus nerve either reduced the seizure frequency or decreased the duration or intensity of seizures.  Adverse side effects were limited to a tingling sensation in the throat and hoarseness during stimulation.  A major complication was mechanical interruption of the wire-electrode circuitry, with consequent cessation of stimulation.  The small number of patients and the relatively short follow-up period make this a pilot study, but the results are promising.",9
"In vivo nonthrombogenicity of heparin immobilized polymer surfaces.  The authors developed two different methods to immobilize heparin on polymer surfaces.  One method involves in situ heparin immobilization on a segmented polyurethane urea (Biomer) surface via hydrophilic poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO, Mn = 4,000) spacers.  The other method uses PEO/poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) block co-polymer and heparin covalently linked in a block co-polymer system (PEO-PDMS-Hep).  These surfaces have demonstrated high heparin bioactivity in vitro and excellent blood compatibility in in vitro-ex vivo experiments.  This report evaluates the long-term in vivo blood compatibility of these heparin immobilized surfaces.  Vascular grafts (6 mm ID, 7 cm in length) were fabricated with Biomer, and heparin was immobilized in situ with PEO spacers (B-PEO4K) and coated on their luminal surfaces with PEO-PDMS-Hep.  Biomer and PEO (Mn = 4,000) grafted Biomer (B-PEO4K) were used as controls.  The grafts were implanted in the abdominal aorta of dogs and retrieved at 3 months or when graft occlusion was suspected.  Retrieved grafts were evaluated with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).  TEM measured the thickness of the adsorbed protein layer on the surface and the protein distribution (albumin, fibrinogen, and IgG) visualized by an immunogold method.  All heparin immobilized grafts were patent at 3 months, whereas Biomer and B-PEO4K grafts occluded within 1 month.  SEM pictures of heparin immobilized surfaces after 3 months demonstrated minimal platelet adhesion and activation without detectable fibrin formation.  Heparin immobilized surfaces showed a thin protein layer (300-600 A) even after 3 months, with high concentrations of albumin and IgG and less fibrinogen.",22
Ligmaject system for local anaesthesia in otology.  The Ligmaject syringe for local anaesthetic injection incorporates a pistol-grip handle and a ratchet system designed to inject a very tiny aliquot of anaesthetic per 'click'.  This instrument was used to provide local anaesthesia for 22 otological procedures on consenting adults.  The performance of the Ligmaject syringe compared favourably with that of the conventional dental syringe in terms of patient acceptability and user convenience.,8
"Long-term prognosis of soft-tissue injuries of the neck.  We reviewed 43 patients who had sustained soft-tissue injuries of the neck after a mean 10.8 years.  Of these, only 12% had recovered completely.  Residual symptoms were intrusive in 28% and severe in 12%.  Pain in the neck and lower back was the commonest complaint and older patients had a worse prognosis.  After two years, symptoms did not alter with further passage of time.",20
"Rapid inactivation and phosphorylation of pyroglutamyl peptidase II in Y-79 human retinoblastoma cells after exposure to phorbol ester.  Pyroglutamyl peptidase II (EC 3.4.19.-), a membrane-bound metalloproteinase, is a highly specific TRH-degrading enzyme.  Exposure of Y-79 human retinoblastoma cells to 12-0-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) decreased the activity of this enzyme in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (IC50 5 x 10(-9) M).  After 15 min of TPA treatment, only 10% of pyroglutamyl peptidase II activity remained.  TPA treatment did not affect the activity of the cytosolic enzyme pyroglutamyl peptidase I (EC 3.4.19.3) or the membrane-bound enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV (EC 3.4.19.3).  Pretreatment of the cells with the protein kinase C inhibitors H-7 or sphingosine prevented the inactivation of pyroglutamyl peptidase II by TPA.  The time course of the TPA-mediated effect paralleled the time course of translocation and activation of protein kinase C in this cell line.  Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that inactivation of pyroglutamyl peptidase II was not due to dissociation or internalization of this enzyme molecule.  Incubation of TPA-activated Y-79 cell membranes with gamma-[32P]-ATP followed by immunoprecipitation revealed a time-dependent phosphorylation of a 48 kilodalton subunit of pyroglutamyl peptidase II.  These studies indicate that the phorbol ester effect is mediated by protein kinase C, and reveal a mechanism of potentiation of the action of TRH at its target sites.",3
"Biliary and gut function following shock.  The aim of this study was to characterize the alterations in gallbladder and intestinal function after hemorrhagic shock and blood reperfusion in opossums.  Animals were subjected to a shock of 30 mm Hg of arterial blood pressure for 60 minutes and resuscitated with blood reinfusion.  Gallbladder epithelial ion transport, gallbladder motility in vitro and in vivo, gastrointestinal motility, and flora of the stomach and small bowel were studied 2 and 24 hours after shock.  Changes at 2 hours included decreased gallbladder contractility in vitro and decreased emptying in vivo, loss of coordination with intestinal motor activity, decrease in frequency of intestinal electrical slow waves, and reduced duration of the intestinal migrating motor complex cycle.  By 24 hours, gallbladder epithelial permeability was increased and in vitro contractility remained reduced but the in vivo functions showed partial recovery.  Gastrointestinal flora was not affected by these changes.  These data demonstrate that hemorrhagic shock and reperfusion affect digestive motility.  The early timing of the alterations observed and the partial recovery 24 hours post shock suggest an ischemia-hypoxia mechanism of injury.",22
"The role of beta-blockade therapy for ventricular tachycardia induced with isoproterenol: a prospective analysis.  Isoproterenol is sometimes required for ventricular tachycardia (VT) induction.  However, the role of beta-blockade for treatment of such VT has not been critically assessed.  The use of beta-blockade was evaluated prospectively in 14 consecutive patients who required isoproterenol 2.4 +/- 1.3 (+/- S.D.) micrograms/min to induce sustained monomorphic VT (greater than 30 seconds, or requiring termination due to hemodynamic collapse) after a negative baseline study.  The VT mechanisms were enhanced automaticity (group A, six patients), triggered automaticity (group B, three patients), and reentry (group C, five patients).  Groups A and B had serial intravenous electropharmacologic tests with propranolol alone (0.2 mg/kg), verapamil alone (0.15 mg/kg), and propranolol plus verapamil, and group C had serial tests with propranolol alone, procainamide or quinidine (class Ia drug) alone, and propranolol plus a class Ia drug until VT could no longer be induced.  All six patients in group A responded to propranolol alone.  In group B, one patient responded to verapamil alone, and two patients responded to propranolol plus verapamil.  In group C, three patients responded to propranolol alone, one patient responded to a class Ia drug alone, and one patient responded to propranolol plus a class Ia drug.  During a follow-up of 7 to 37 (17.9 +/- 10.7) (+/- S.D.) months, VT has not recurred in any patient.  Three patients treated initially with propranolol alone have required substitution of amiodarone due to refractory congestive heart failure.  In patients requiring isoproterenol for VT induction, beta-blockade alone appears to be effective in preventing reinduction of VT caused by enhanced automaticity.  A heterogeneous response occurs when the VT mechanisms are triggered automaticity or reentry.",13
"Glucose disposal, beta-cell secretion, and hepatic insulin extraction in cirrhosis: a minimal model assessment.  Factors controlling glucose metabolism after IV load were studied in nine patients with compensated cirrhosis and in six age-matched controls.  The time courses of glucose, insulin, and C peptide were analyzed by means of the minimal model technique.  In cirrhosis, insulin sensitivity was reduced by approximately 70% and glucose-dependent glucose uptake (glucose effectiveness) by 45%.  Decreased glucose effectiveness explained 65% of the variance of glucose disappearance and correlated with the ratio of urinary creatinine to height, an independent measure of muscle mass (r = 0.839).  beta-cell responsiveness to glucose, measured on C-peptide kinetics, was variable and increased on average by 170% and 107% (first-phase and second-phase, respectively).  The total amount of insulin secreted by beta-cells in the course of the study was nearly doubled, whereas the basal insulin secretion rate was in the normal range.  The time courses of hepatic extraction of insulin did not differ between groups, and basal extraction was on average 58% in controls and 56% in patients with cirrhosis.  It was reduced to 30% in a single patient who had severe hepatocellular failure and large spontaneous portosystemic shunting.  We conclude that the alterations in glucose metabolism of cirrhosis include a decreased insulin sensitivity, a reduced glucose effectiveness, and an increased pancreatic responsiveness to glucose, leading to hyperinsulinemia.  The hepatic extraction of insulin is reduced only in the very advanced stages of the disease, possibly because of a large reserve capacity of the hepatic parenchyma.",5
"A glance at the urodynamic database.  Three hundred sixty-four patients with urinary incontinence as their presenting complaint were evaluated in the urogynecology laboratory, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York.  Of them, 226 (62%) were found to have genuine stress urinary incontinence (GSI).  This subset of demonstrably incontinent patients was characterized as to symptoms of stress and urge incontinence, incidence of nulliparity, occurrence of incontinence during intercourse and influence of weight on bladder pressure.  Using clusters of symptoms did not accurately distinguish GSI from the other types of urinary incontinence.  Four percent of the GSI patients were nulliparous.  All had a reasonable explanation for incontinence other than anatomic relaxation.  Twenty-three percent of the 154 sexually active GSI patients acknowledged having incontinence with intercourse.  None of the anatomic and urodynamic parameters evaluated distinguished that group from their GSI counterparts who did not lose urine with intercourse.  Increasing weight, expressed as the body mass index, correlated with an increase in the vesical pressure in the supine and standing positions.",11
"Prerandomization: an alternative to classic randomization. The effects on recruitment in a controlled trial of arthroscopy for osteoarthrosis of the knee.  Possibly the greatest threat to the success of a randomized clinical trial is the inability to recruit an adequate number of subjects.  Concern that the randomized clinical trial will adversely affect the physician-patient relationship is the most common reason for physicians' reluctance to enroll patients in such trials.  We report a modification of a prerandomized design, first described by Zelen, which was implemented in a randomized clinical trial of arthroscopy for patients who had osteoarthrosis of the knee.  The method was associated with a sixfold increase in the rate of accrual of patients as compared with the use of a classic randomization trial.  We propose the design as a potential solution to the problem of recruitment of subjects, particularly for clinical studies.",4
"Whole bowel irrigation and the cocaine body-packer: a new approach to a common problem.  Gastrointestinal drug smuggling is a common problem in many major cities.  Though the majority of cases never require medical attention, the ""body-packer"" frequently presents with life-threatening symptoms of intoxication, including seizures and cardiorespiratory collapse, as well as mechanical obstruction from the ingested drug packets.  The risk to asymptomatic smugglers may vary with packaging materials, and remains unknown.  Lack of controlled studies, and variations in packaging materials and clinical outcomes have prevented formulation of a consistent management strategy.  Current recommendations for asymptomatic body-packers vary from immediate surgical removal, to use of laxatives, to observation.  The authors present the first reported case of an asymptomatic cocaine body-packer treated with whole bowel irrigation with polyethylene glycol electrolyte lavage solution.  This strategy was safe, well tolerated, resulted in the rapid elimination of drug packets from the gastrointestinal tract, and facilitated assessment by contrast radiography.  The potential benefits and limitations for the use of whole bowel irrigation in this difficult problem are discussed.",20
"Effect of inhaled methacholine on inspiratory flow.  One hundred consecutive outpatients with symptoms suggestive of asthma who came to the Pulmonary Function Laboratory for a methacholine challenge test were studied.  In addition to the forced expiratory maneuvers, forced inspiratory maneuvers were performed before and after the maximal response to methacholine.  In 24 patients, the methacholine challenge suggested that they had asthma (forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1] decrease greater than or equal to 20 percent).  Six of these 24 patients also had a decrease in maximal forced inspiratory flow (FIFmax) greater than or equal to 20 percent and nine had a decrease in forced inspiratory flow at 50 percent of vital capacity (FIF50) greater than or equal to 20 percent, suggesting that bronchoconstriction can cause decreased inspiratory as well as expiratory flows.  In 76 patients, the methacholine challenges were ""negative"" (FEV1 decrease less than or equal to 20 percent), suggesting that they did not have asthma.  Nevertheless, in 11 of these 76 patients the FIFmax decrease was greater than or equal to 20 percent, and in 14 patients the FIF50 decrease was greater than or equal to 20 percent, suggesting that intermittent central airway obstruction is responsible for these patients' symptoms.",19
"Dust mite assays in clinical allergy practice: mite antigen exposures among skin test positive patients in Kansas.  We have attempted to determine whether sensitive monoclonal antibody assays for Dermatophagoides mite antigens Der p I and Der f I can be carried out in a private clinical allergy practice laboratory, to ascertain incidence of significant home mite exposure in dust samples from patient homes in Kansas, and to consider whether such information impacts on patient management.  We analyzed 152 dust samples from 62 patient homes.  All patients were skin prick test positive for one or both common mite species available for skin testing, and had potentially relevant histories.  Der p I and Der f I antigen levels were added together, and levels above 2 micrograms/g of dust were considered ""positive."" By this definition, elevated levels were found in at least one sample from 48 of 62 homes tested (77%); however, 61% of mattress samples tested, 41% of carpet samples, and 54.5% of furniture samples had levels below those considered likely to cause symptoms.  Only 13 of 152 samples yielded Der p I levels above 2 micrograms/g.  We conclude that monoclonal antibody assays for Der p I and Der f I antigens can be performed in a well-equipped office laboratory staffed by trained medical technologists, that Der f I is the predominant mite species in Kansas, and that data derived from mite assays may be important in treatment planning for patients suspected of having mite-related allergy symptoms.",19
"Oral terbinafine versus griseofulvin in the treatment of moccasin-type tinea pedis.  The safety and effectiveness of oral terbinafine, 125 mg twice daily, and griseofulvin, 250 mg twice daily, in patients with moccasin-type tinea pedis were examined in a double-blind randomized trial.  At the end of the 6-week treatment period, both a clinical and mycologic cure or a mycologic cure with minimal signs of infection was noted in 12 (75%) of the 16 terbinafine-treated patients compared with only 3 (27%) of the 12 patients treated with griseofulvin.  The overall response rate 2 weeks after the completion of treatment was 88% in the terbinafine-treated group and 45% in the griseofulvin-treated group.  When contacted again 6 to 15 months after completion of the study, 94% of the terbinafine-treated patients reported sustained clearing of tinea pedis, and 88% of those with nail involvement at the time of treatment reported improvement.  In contrast, tinea pedis remained cured in only 30% of the patients who had received griseofulvin, and onychomycosis improved in only 14%.",0
"Maintenance of circulation during ventricular fibrillation with the simultaneous use of two ""counterpulsation"" devices.  Two valveless, single orifice counterpulsation devices, with pumping stroke volumes of 65 ml each, were implanted on the ascending aorta and pulmonary artery of seven open chest anesthetized dogs.  After completion of the preparation, ventricular fibrillation was induced.  The devices were synchronized to pump simultaneously at a rate of 85-100 bpm.  The combined use of the counterpulsation devices provided maximal aortic pressure of 111.4 +/- 25.1 mmHg during ventricular fibrillation for a period of 15-60 min.  The mean left ventricular pressure was 17.7 +/- 4.4 mmHg, and the cardiac index 64.5 +/- 23.6 ml/kg/min.  Cardioversion of ventricular fibrillation to sinus rhythm restored normal hemodynamics.  The counterpulsation device implanted on the ascending aorta was not able to maintain circulation for more than 5 min after the induction of ventricular fibrillation, if used alone.  In conclusion, the use of two counterpulsation devices implanted on the ascending aorta and pulmonary artery was able to maintain circulation in experimental animals during ventricular fibrillation.",22
"Outcome of patients with chronic affective disorder: a five-year follow-up.  Patients with major depression, mania, or schizo-affective disorder that had been present without remission for 2 years or more at intake (N = 129) were followed prospectively for 5 years, as were 580 patients who had been ill for shorter periods at intake.  Despite very substantial durations of episode, three-quarters of the chronic patients recovered, although recovery occurred much later in the follow-up period than it did among the nonchronic patients.  Factors associated with recovery were less severe illness at intake, lack of psychotic features, good friendship patterns in adolescence, and, most important, a relatively high maximum level of functioning in the 5 years preceding intake.",22
"Arachnoid granulation cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea.  A case report and review of the temporal bone (TB) collection in the Department of Otolaryngology at SUNY Health Science Center in Syracuse demonstrated the occurrence of arachnoid granulations (AGs) in the posterior fossa surface of the TB and their role in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) otorrhea.  A large AG responsible for CSF otorrhea in a 64-year-old man was excised with soft tissue repair of the dural defect.  Sixteen of 188 TBs (8.5%) in the collection contained 24 AGs ranging in size from 0.07 to 80.65 mm3.  Nine AGs (37%) were small (less than 1 mm3) and did not demonstrate enlargement.  Twelve (50%) were of intermediate size (2.50 to 9.32 mm3), and three (13%) were large (49.82 to 80.65 mm3).  The intermediate and large AGs were associated with bone erosion and a high incidence of communication with a pneumatized mastoid complex (serous otitis media or meningitis).  These findings suggest that AGs of sufficient size to produce bone erosion are the primary responsible lesions in adult-onset spontaneous CSF otorrhea.",4
"Effects of bepridil and diltiazem on ventricular repolarization in angina pectoris.  To examine the time-course and potential predictors of prolongation of ventricular repolarization with the calcium antagonist bepridil, the effects of bepridil (300 to 500 mg/day; n = 45) and diltiazem (180 to 300 mg/day; n = 42) on QT and QTc interval duration were analyzed in a randomized double-blind study in patients with angina pectoris.  Electrocardiograms were recorded before and 14, 28, 70 and 112 days after treatment was begun.  After 14 days, bepridil prolonged QT interval by 26 +/- 35 ms (range, -60 to 120 ms) and QTc (Bazett's formula) by 17 +/- 33 ms (range, -73 to 107 ms) compared to baseline (both p less than 0.05).  QT or QTc did not significantly increase thereafter.  However, among the 30 patients who had less than 40 ms QTc prolongation at day 14 compared with baseline, 13 (43%) exceeded this limit on at least 1 of the following visits.  Diltiazem did not significantly alter QT or QTc intervals.  The absolute change in QTc interval from baseline observed after 14 days of bepridil therapy was inversely proportional to the baseline QTc interval (r = -0.68; n = 42; p less than 0.001).  The degree of bepridil-induced QTc prolongation on day 14 correlated with pretreatment RR interval (r = 0.36; n = 42; p less than 0.02).  In conclusion, chronic administration of bepridil but not of diltiazem prolongs ventricular repolarization in patients with angina pectoris.  The overall effects of bepridil therapy on QT and QTc intervals can be assessed by an electrocardiogram recorded after 14 days of treatment but subsequent measurements may be required in individual patients.  A short baseline QTc interval and a slow initial heart rate may be potentially useful predictors of a greater QTc prolongation with bepridil.",13
"Extracorporeal removal of anti-HLA antibodies in transplant candidates.  We report on the results of a clinical trial in which 14 transplant candidates were treated with an extracorporeal immunoadsorption system using Protein A that selectively removes immunoglobulin from plasma; we also assessed the dynamics of anti-HLA antibody as a model of IgG removal and re-equilibration, as well as the clinical safety of the procedure.  At the end of a treatment course, plasma IgG levels were reduced by 90% +/- 8% of control values (P less than 0.01).  In contrast, albumin levels were reduced by only 15% (P less than 0.05).  Specific cytotoxic anti-HLA antibody titers were reduced by approximately 18-fold.  Panel reactivity was measured as the proportion of a 40-member cell donor panel killed by patients' serum in the presence of complement; in nine of the 14 patients, there was a significant reduction in this parameter (range, 23% to 87%).  During the 4-week follow-up period, anti-HLA antibody titers returned to baseline levels.  There were no remarkable changes observed in blood chemistries, nor were there any unanticipated adverse reactions seen in the patients treated.  We conclude that selective extracorporeal immunoadsorption is a safe and effective way of removing IgG-type antibodies, with potential application to reduction of HLA antibodies in transplant candidates.",11
"Association of fasting glucose levels with a delayed secretion of insulin after oral glucose in subjects with glucose intolerance.  Two hundred and nineteen second generation Japanese-American men were classified with a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test: 77 with normal glucose tolerance, 74 with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and 68 with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).  The peak insulin response to the oral glucose load was progressively delayed with each of the 3 glucose tolerance categories.  A similar finding was observed with the peak C-peptide response to oral glucose, except for the absence of distinction between IGT and NIDDM.  Variables measuring the initial rate of insulin or C-peptide secretion (0-30 min) after oral glucose also demonstrated a progressive diminution with increasing glucose intolerance.  The relative incremental insulin response at 30 min and the relative incremental C-peptide response at 30 min were highly correlated with the fasting glucose levels (r = -0.61 and r = -0.62; P less than 0.0001, respectively).  Variables measuring the 0-30 min secretory response had high variances, whereas the variance for fasting glucose was low.  Twelve men who were initially classified as IGT subsequently developed NIDDM.  These 12 men had significantly higher fasting glucose levels at baseline than the remaining men who did not develop diabetes, but the 30 min secretory parameters after oral glucose, although lower in those who subsequently developed diabetes, were not significantly different at baseline.  However, if fasting glucose is used as a surrogate measure of secretory response, these 12 men appear to have had an impairment of oral glucose-stimulated insulin secretion antedating the development of NIDDM.  The inability of the secretory parameters to detect the abnormality may be due to a type II statistical error, which may be resolved by a larger sample size.",17
"Direct ultrasonographic measurement of fetal lung length in normal pregnancies and pregnancies complicated by prolonged rupture of membranes.  Fetal lung length was measured directly with ultrasonography in 20 patients with prolonged rupture of membranes, commencing before 25 weeks' gestation.  Measurements were made weekly and compared with data collected from 310 normal pregnancies.  Measurement of fetal lung length by ultrasonography was a good predictor of pulmonary hypoplasia, predicting greater than 90% of cases.  There was a good correlation between lung size assessed by the last ultrasonographic examination and lung weight postmortem (r = 0.783, p less than 0.05).  Lung length measurements were superior to fetal chest circumference measurements in the identification of pulmonary hypoplasia.  There was a significant negative association between the amount of amniotic fluid and pulmonary hypoplasia (p less than 0.05).  There were fetuses with pulmonary hypoplasia that had respiratory movements seen at the majority of ultrasonographic examinations.",12
"Clostridium difficile invasion and toxin circulation in fatal pediatric pseudomembranous colitis.  The direct involvement of Clostridium difficile in the lesional tissue of pseudomembranous colitis has not been demonstrated; the organism's effects have been assumed to be strictly toxin mediated.  Because C.  difficile cytotoxin may be found incidentally in the intestinal lumina of asymptomatic infants, the role of the organism in a variety of pediatric intestinal diseases is uncertain.  The authors studied seven cases of fatal pediatric pseudomembranous colitis in which the presence of C.  difficile was uniformly demonstrable in lesional tissues with the use of both an intestinal spore stain and a specific immunostain.  The patients had either underlying Hirschsprung's disease or hematologic malignancy; the striking pathologic features peculiar to these patients were altered mucosal mucin and immunologic barriers in the former group and neutropenia in the latter.  Two patients had demonstrable circulating cytotoxin in serum or ascitic fluid, and C.  difficile was identified invading colonic mucosa or submucosa.  Such phenomena did not occur in control pediatric patients with multiple other intestinal lesions.  Altered host factors may be responsible for the intestinal invasion of C.  difficile and its systemic toxin circulation in cases of fatal pediatric pseudomembranous colitis.",0
"Vision screening in a primary care setting. A missed opportunity?  To determine the effectiveness of vision screening in a primary care setting, we administered a questionnaire and a vision test to 458 patients from a general medical clinic.  Subjects were referred for complete ophthalmologic evaluation if they failed the vision test or met other ""high-risk"" criteria based on information contained in the questionnaire.  Patient-initiated requests for eye examinations were also honored.  A total of 169 patients were scheduled for eye examinations, and 148 actually underwent ophthalmologic evaluation.  One hundred one of those examined were referred on the basis of the study criteria.  ""Serious eye disease"" (cataract, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, or age-related macular degeneration) was diagnosed in 96 (95%) of these patients.  Prompt surgical intervention was recommended in 27 (27%), and medical treatment was begun in 21 (21%).  Of those with serious eye disease, 59% met the criteria by failing the vision test, while 69% met the high-risk criteria determined by the questionnaire.  Of the 148 subjects who received ophthalmologic evaluations, 47 requested them.  Serious eye disease was diagnosed in 23 (50%) of the 47 patients.  None of these individuals required immediate surgery, and medical treatment for glaucoma was begun in eight (17%).  These data suggest that screening for serious eye disease in a primary care setting is an efficient mechanism to use for the identification of patients with undetected ocular disorders that require follow-up or treatment.",10
"Femoral arteriovenous fistula as a complication of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. A report of five cases.  Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) associated with invasive and diagnostic angiographic procedures is rare.  The incidence is increased with procedures such as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) but is still quite low.  We report five cases of AVF within a 17-month period, representing 0.15 per cent of all cardiac catheterizations and 0.87 per cent of PTCAs.  All five patients presented with groin bruits.  There were two associated pseudoaneurysms and one patient with deep vein thrombosis.  All patients underwent uneventful division of the fistula.  A thorough understanding of the anatomy of the femoral triangle is necessary in order to avoid this complication.  That all fistulas were in the superficial or profunda femoris arteries emphasizes the importance of avoiding a low groin puncture.  Early angiography and surgical intervention are recommended for optimal results.",22
"The recombinant immunotoxin anti-Tac(Fv)-Pseudomonas exotoxin 40 is cytotoxic toward peripheral blood malignant cells from patients with adult T-cell leukemia.  Anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 is a recombinant single-chain immunotoxin containing the heavy and light variable regions of the anti-Tac monoclonal antibody fused to a mutant form of Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE).  Anti-Tac binds to the p55 subunit of the human interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor, and anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 kills human or monkey cell lines that contain either the intact IL-2 receptor or its p55 subunit alone.  To assess the usefulness of anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 in treatment of IL-2 receptor-positive leukemia, we tested peripheral blood mononuclear cells from six patients with adult T-cell leukemia.  In each of the six patients, anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 was extremely cytotoxic to the malignant cells.  Metabolic activity and sensitivity of the fresh cells improved when a small amount of IL-2 (10 units per ml) was present during incubation.  The toxin concentration necessary to inhibit protein synthesis by 50% after 16-hr incubation of cells with immunotoxin varied from 1.6 to 16 ng/ml (2.5-25 x 10(-11) M).  In every case, binding was by means of the Tac antigen because anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 cytotoxicity was prevented by adding excess anti-Tac antibody.  Moreover, anti-Tac alone or an inactive mutant of anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 without ADP-ribosylation activity had very little cytotoxic activity.  Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from normal controls, from a patient with Tac-negative leukemia, and from adult T-cell leukemia patients without significant peripheral blood involvement were not sensitive to anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40.  These results indicate that anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 is a potent cytotoxin against adult T-cell leukemia cells in vitro and warrants clinical testing.",3
"Triplet tubal pregnancy treated by outpatient laparoscopic salpingostomy.  To our knowledge, this represents the first case of a laparoscopically treated triplet EP and the first time that a double EP in the same tube was treated conservatively (with preservation of the tube).  Multiple EPs may be more common than currently thought, and our report offers an alternative explanation for at least some cases of persistent EP after conservative surgical therapy.  Finally, given the substantial cost savings and reduced postoperative recovery time associated with operative laparoscopy, when the patient is stable and the surgeon experienced, the laparoscopic approach should be tried, regardless of the number of EPs or their size.",12
Magnetic resonance imaging of vertebral osteoblastoma: a report of two cases.  Two patients with vertebral osteoblastoma evaluated with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are presented.  A literature review revealed that cases of osteoblastoma originating within the vertebral body are exceedingly rare.,3
"Reproducibility of growth hormone testing procedures: a comparison between 24-hour integrated concentration and pharmacological stimulation.  The purpose of this study was to compare the reproducibility of two approaches to the evaluation of GH secretion: the integrated concentration of GH (IC-GH), a physiological test of GH secretion, and pharmacological stimulation tests.  IC-GH was determined in 40 poorly growing children twice within 4 weeks.  The first and second IC-GH were highly correlated r = 0.859, P less than 0.001.  One hundred and thirteen poorly growing children underwent pharmacological GH stimulation tests twice within 6 weeks.  A moderate correlation was found between the first and second pharmacological test r = 0.524, P less than 0.01.  Among the three pharmacological stimuli studied, clonidine (n = 81) had the highest reproducibility followed by arginine (n = 20), and insulin (n = 12).  We conclude that IC-GH is more consistently reproducible than the GH response to repeated pharmacological stimulation.",22
"Parenchymal and vascular magnetic resonance imaging of the brain after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.  Three-dimensional (volume) magnetic resonance angiography is a new and noninvasive method for imaging the intracranial vasculature.  The combination of magnetic resonance angiography and conventional magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate brain parenchyma and vessels in 30 survivors of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.  Magnetic resonance imaging findings were abnormal in 33% of the patients, with no increased frequency of right hemispheric lesions.  Magnetic resonance angiography demonstrated good intracranial flow in all infants and demonstrable right internal carotid arterial flow in 35% of those patients with permanent carotid ligation.  An abnormal magnetic resonance imaging study was found more often in infants with abnormal predischarge neurologic examination results.  These techniques have several advantages over other neuroimaging modalities, including better definition of deep structures, myelin formation, and intracranial vasculature, the absence of bone artifact, and the elimination of catheter or contrast use.",15
"The effects of phenylephrine on right ventricular performance in patients with pulmonary hypertension   Pulmonary hypertension causes right ventricular ischemia and failure as a result of increased afterload combined with reduced coronary blood flow.  Increasing coronary driving pressure by raising aortic pressure with phenylephrine has been shown to reverse right ventricular ischemia from pulmonary hypertension in animals.  Since vasodilators often fail to reduce afterload, we tested whether raising the coronary driving pressure would improve right ventricular function in man.  Ten patients with pulmonary hypertension had hemodynamics and right ventricular coronary driving pressure measured before and 10 minutes after a steady state was reached with a phenylephrine infusion titrated to raise aortic pressure by 25 percent.  Phenylephrine caused a significant (p less than .01) increase in mean aortic pressure (84 to 108 mm Hg) and right ventricular coronary driving pressure (46 to 69 mm Hg).  In response, there was a significant (p less than .01) rise in mean pulmonary artery pressure (58 to 67 mm Hg), right ventricular end-diastolic pressure (10 to 16 mm Hg) and wedge pressure (5 to 9 mm Hg), and an insignificant fall in cardiac output (3.26 to 3.09 L/min) and pulmonary artery O2 saturation (57 to 49 percent).  Although phenylephrine increased right ventricular coronary driving pressure, it worsened right ventricular function as manifest by a rise in end-diastolic pressure and fall in cardiac output.  Any benefit of raising right ventricular coronary driving pressure may have been offset by alpha vasoconstriction of right ventricular coronary blood flow and/or pulmonary arterial vasoconstriction.  Phenylephrine does not appear to be a useful therapy of right ventricular failure from pulmonary hypertension in patients who fail vasodilators.",13
"Pulsed carbon dioxide laser ablation of burned skin: in vitro and in vivo analysis.  Pulsed lasers produce efficient and precise tissue ablation with limited residual thermal damage.  In this study, the efficiency of pulsed CO2 laser ablation of burned and normal swine skin was studied in vitro with a mass loss technique.  The heats of ablation for normal and burned skin were 2,706 and 2,416 J/cm3 of tissue ablated, respectively.  The mean threshold radiant exposures for ablating normal skin and eschar were 2.6 J/cm2 and 3.0 J/cm2, respectively.  Radiant exposures greater than 19 J/cm2 produced a plasma, which decreased the efficiency of laser ablation.  Thus the radiant exposures for efficient ablation range from 4 to 19 J/cm2, and within this radiant exposure range 20-40 microns of tissue are ablated per pulse.  We also examined, on a gross and histopathologic basis, in vivo burn eschar excision with a pulsed CO2 laser.  The laser allowed bloodless excisions of full thickness burns on the backs of male hairless rats.  The zone of thermal damage was approximately 85 microns over the subjacent fascia.  The pulsed CO2 laser can ablate burn eschar efficiently, precisely, and bloodlessly and may prove valuable for the excision of burned and necrotic tissue.",20
"The anatomy and physiology of nerve injury.  Nerves have a structure of considerable complexity with features of special relevance to nerve injury and nerve regeneration.  These include variations in the cross-sectional areas devoted to fascicular and epineurial tissue, the fascicular redistribution and mixing of different branch fibers brought about by fascicular plexuses, and the numbers of nerve fibers representing individual branches.  The elasticity and tensile strength of nerve trunks and their capacity to resist traction deformation reside in the fascicular tissue, while the epineurium provides a protective cushion against compression.  The microstructure of nerve trunks provides the basis for a classification of nerve injuries into five degrees of severity with partial and mixed types--each with a clearly defined pathology and distinguishing clinical features.  Following a transection injury, changes occur in the severed axons, endoneurial tubes, fasciculi, and nerve trunk.  The type of injury and the nature of these changes determine the outcome of axon regeneration.",22
"Technetium-99m sestamibi in chronic coronary artery disease: the European experience.  Since the introduction of technetium-99m methoxy-isobutyl isonitrile (Tc-99m sestamibi) in Europe, there has been a growing interest in its use.  Several European multicenter trials have been conducted to evaluate this new agent in relation to the traditional perfusion marker thallium-201, and other studies are in progress to understand the use of this perfusion marker for the diagnosis of coronary disease, for use in conjunction with pharmacologic vasodilation, for use in the assessment of ventricular function and wall motion and for the assessment of interventions.",13
"Arterial blood oxygen desaturation in infants and children during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.  Arterial blood oxygen desaturation and abnormal electrocardiographic changes have been reported in adults undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.  We studied 32 infants and children less than 12 years of age using pulse oximetry and continuous electrocardiography before, during, and after upper gastrointestinal endoscopy performed under intravenous sedation.  Sinus tachycardia was the most common electrocardiographic change, and no clinically significant electrocardiographic abnormalities were induced by the procedure.  Desaturation to less than or equal to 90% was found in 37.5% of the patients and was most commonly noted during the endoscopy procedure and in patients with cardiopulmonary disease.  The desaturation was unpredictable because there was no correlation between desaturation and medication, tolerance to the procedure, weight, or age of the child.  Some patients who subjectively appeared to tolerate the procedure well had significant desaturation.  The use of pulse oximetry should be considered for all children undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.",13
Posterior mediastinal teratoma with abdominal extension.  Posterior mediastinal benign teratomas are uncommon neoplasms in infancy; nine cases have been reported so far.  A one month old baby was found to have a benign posterior mediastinal teratoma infiltrating the lower oesophagus from the level of the carina through the oesophageal hiatus into the upper abdomen.  Partial oesophagectomy provided a successful outcome.,3
"Cytogenetic analysis of 750 spontaneous abortions with the direct-preparation method of chorionic villi and its implications for studying genetic causes of pregnancy wastage.  Altogether, 750 cases of spontaneous abortion between the fifth and 25th week of gestation were analyzed cytogenetically by the direct-preparation method using chorionic villi.  The majority of cases (68%) were derived from early abortions before the 12th week of gestation.  The frequency of abnormal karyotypes was 50.1%; trisomy was predominant (62.1%), followed by triploidy (12.4%), monosomy X (10.5%), tetraploidy (9.2%), and structural chromosome anomalies (4.7%).  Among trisomies, chromosomes 16 (21.8%), 22 (17.9%), and 21 (10.0%) were prevalent.  The frequency of chromosomally abnormal abortions increased with maternal age but only because of an increase of trisomy.  Polyploidy and monosomy X, however, decreased.  Mean maternal age was significantly increased for trisomies 16, 21, and 22 and was highest for trisomies 18 and 20.  The results obtained are within the range of variability reported earlier from tissue culture-type studies.  A consistent feature during our study is the excess of females in chromosomally normal abortions (male:female sex ratio 0.71).  According to the methodology applied, maternal cell contamination and undetected 46,XX molar samples cannot have influenced the sex ratio.  However, a bias introduced by social status or maternal age cannot be excluded.  With the more rapid and convenient direct preparation of chorionic villi, reliable cytogenetic data on causes of spontaneous abortions can be obtained.",22
"The spectrum of emergency care of agricultural trauma in central Wisconsin.  Agriculture is among the most dangerous occupations in the United States.  When injuries do occur, the emergency department (ED) is the primary source of care.  Over a 2-year period, the emergency medicine section of the Marshfield Clinic/St Joseph's Hospital, cared for 913 victims of agricultural trauma.  Although 11% were initially admitted and 4% were later treated, the remainder received their care solely in the ED.  Unlike most occupational injuries, people of any age may be involved in agricultural injuries; 27% in this series were less than 18 years of age and 5% were 65 years or older.  Just over half of all injuries were from mechanical devices, including tractor and farm machinery.  The remainder were from animals, falls, or exposure.  Although several different types of injuries occurred, the most common diagnoses were soft tissue injuries and fractures and the most common procedure was diagnostic radiography followed by wound and fracture care.  An ED in a rural setting should be prepared to deal with agricultural trauma.",20
"Glucocorticoids locally disrupt an array of positioned nucleosomes on the rat tyrosine aminotransferase promoter in hepatoma cells.  Transcriptional activation by steroid hormones is often associated with the appearance of a DNase I hypersensitive site resulting from a local alteration of the nucleoprotein structure of the promoter.  For the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat, a viral promoter under glucocorticoid control, a model has been proposed: the appearance of the hormonodependent DNase I hypersensitive site reflects the displacement of a single precisely positioned nucleosome associated with the glucocorticoid responsive elements.  To determine if such a mechanism is of general relevance in transcriptional activation by steroid hormones, we have investigated the nucleosomal organization of the rat tyrosine aminotransferase promoter over a 1-kilobase region that contains the glucocorticoid regulatory target.  This region displays a hormonodependent DNase I hypersensitive site.  In the absence of hormone, micrococcal nuclease digestion of nuclei demonstrates the presence of positioned nucleosomes, with cutting sites centered around positions -3080, -2900, -2700, -2800, -2255, and -2040.  Treatment of the cells with dexamethasone induces a disruption of the chromatin structure over a relatively short stretch of DNA (approximately positions -2400 to -2650) that overlaps two nucleosomes.  These observations suggest a strong similarity in the role of chromatin structure in glucocorticoid-dependent transcriptional activation of mouse mammary tumor virus and tyrosine aminotransferase promoters.",3
"The epidemiology and natural history of pressure ulcers in elderly nursing home residents   We analyzed prospective data from 19,889 elderly residents of 51 nursing homes from 1984 to 1985 to determine the prevalence, incidence, and natural history of pressure ulcers.  Among all residents admitted to nursing homes, 11.3% possessed a stage II through stage IV pressure ulcer.  For those residents admitted to the nursing home without pressure ulcers during the study period, the 1-year incidence was 13.2%.  This increased to 21.6% by 2 years of nursing home stay.  People already residing in a nursing home at the start of the study had a 1-year incidence of 9.5%, which increased to 20.4% by 2 years.  Pressure ulcers were associated with an increased rate of mortality, but not hospitalization.  Longitudinal follow-up of residents with pressure ulcers demonstrated that a majority of their lesions were healed by 1 year.  Most of the improvement occurred early in a person's nursing home stay.  Although nursing home residents with pressure ulcers have a higher mortality, with good medical care pressure ulcers can be expected to heal.",16
"Effect of nontransmural necrosis on epicardial potential fields. Correlation with fiber direction.  The effect of nontransmural necrosis on epicardial potential distributions was studied in 13 dogs.  In previous studies, left ventricular epicardial pacing generated epicardial potential maps at QRS onset with a negative central area and two positive areas that faced the portions of the wavefront propagating along fibers.  Subsequently, the positive areas expanded in a counterclockwise direction by 90 degrees to 120 degrees.  In those studies, the rotatory expansion of the positive areas was tentatively attributed to the spread of excitation through deep myocardial layers, where fiber direction rotated counterclockwise from epicardium to endocardium.  To test this hypothesis, we tried to interrupt the counterclockwise expansion of the positive area by creating localized, nontransmural necrosis at various depths in the left ventricular wall by injection of formalin or application of laser energy.  Epicardial potential maps were obtained from a grid of 12 x 15 electrodes on a 44 x 56-mm area.  Epicardial pacing from selected sites generated epicardial maps in which some positive areas were missing compared with controls.  The direction of the straight line joining the pacing site to the site of missing positivity correlated well with the average fiber direction in the necrotic mass (r = 0.82, p less than 0.01).  Angle between epicardial fiber direction and the straight line described above correlated well with the average depth of the necrosis, expressed as percent of the wall thickness (r = 0.95, p less than 0.01).  These data support the hypothesis that the counterclockwise expansion of the epicardial positivity occurring after epicardial pacing results from excitation spreading along deep fibers.",22
"Generation of ammonia and mucosal lesion formation following hydrolysis of urea by urease in the rat stomach.  We examined the morphological changes in gastric mucosa and the generation of ammonia after exposure of the rat stomach to urea in the presence of urease, in attempts to investigate a pathophysiological role of urea, urease, and ammonia system in gastric ulcer diseases.  Exposure of the stomach for 20 min to 2 ml urea (0.025-0.2%) together with urease (100 IU) induced histological damages in a concentration-related manner.  Either urea or urease alone did not induce any histological change in the mucosa.  Instillation of urea into the stomach generated ammonia in the presence of urease; the amount of ammonia was increased depending on the concentration of urea, and was closely associated with the severity of histological damage.  The exposure of the stomach to ammonia (NH4OH: 0.01-0.1%) also produced histological damages in the gastric mucosa in a concentration-related manner.  The characteristics of injury induced by 0.5-1.0% ammonia were stasis of microcirculation, disruption of the surface epithelial cells, and necrosis of the mucosa.  These results demonstrated that ammonia generated from the hydrolysis of urea by urease in the stomach causes damages in the gastric mucosa.",5
"Short-term and long-term changes in renal function after donor nephrectomy.  We retrospectively examined the effect of nephrectomy on renal function in 55 living related donors.  Renal function was measured with 131iodine-orthoiodohippurate scans.  All patients were studied preoperatively, and 1 week and 1 year postoperatively.  In 20 patients 10-year followup was available.  Compensatory hypertrophy was complete 1 week postoperatively: effective renal plasma flow of the remaining kidney was 32.5% higher than preoperatively.  The increase remained stable for at least a year.  The degree of compensatory hypertrophy was significantly greater in male patients (46.9% after 1 week) than in female patients (26.7%).  Compensatory hypertrophy occurred in all age groups studied and it was most pronounced in patients less than 30 years old.  In the patients followed for 10 years effective renal plasma flow decreased from 387.7 ml.  per minute 1 week after nephrectomy to 367.4 ml.  per minute at 10 years.  This result is similar to the decrease seen in the normal population.  According to our results, renal donation by living related persons does not lead to long-term decrease in renal function.",22
"Epidemiologic aspects of heart failure.  The prevalence of heart failure in Northwest London is 0.4%, a lower figure than that quoted for the United States.  Heart failure is a common reason (5%) for medical admission to the hospital in the London area.  The problem of heart failure is predominantly in persons over 65 years.  Coronary artery disease is the most frequent cause, and hypertension is relatively uncommon.  In those patients admitted to the hospital, the prognosis is poor.",13
"Induction of RNA-stabilized DNA conformers by transcription of an immunoglobulin switch region   A deletion DNA rearrangement is associated with immunoglobulin class switching from IgM to IgG, IgA or IgE This recombination occurs in immunoglobulin switch regions, which are complex, highly repetitive regions of DNA.  As switch regions become transcriptionally active just before switch recombination, analysis of the behaviour of these sequences during transcription could elucidate the mechanism of switch recombination.  Here, we report that transcription of a supercoiled plasmid containing the murine IgA switch region (S alpha) leads to a loss of superhelical turns.  The resulting series of less supercoiled plasmids is stabilized by RNA-DNA hybrids formed by the nascent RNA transcripts, which remain base-paired with their DNA templates.",22
"Localization and surgical treatment of occult insulinomas.  Management of patients with biochemical evidence of insulinoma and negative preoperative imaging studies (occult) tumors is controversial, varying from primarily medical management to aggressive, blind nearly total pancreatectomy to extirpate the tumor.  Since 1982, 12 consecutive patients with occult insulinoma underwent preoperative portal venous sampling (PVS) for insulin followed by surgical exploration with intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS).  Eleven of twelve patients (92%) had insulinoma removed and were cured.  Portal venous sampling correctly predicted the location of the insulinoma in 9 patients (75%) and that no tumor would be found in another patient.  A fourfold insulin gradient in the pancreatic tail of one patient correctly predicted that a distal pancreatectomy would remove the insulinoma despite the fact that neither palpation nor IOUS identified any tumor.  Intraoperative ultrasound was the single best method to identify occult tumors because it correctly identified 10 of 11 insulinomas that were found, including five pancreatic head tumors that were not palpable.  Palpation identified five insulinomas.  Of the 10 tumors that were identified during operation by palpation or ultrasound, IOUS identified significantly more (100% versus 50%, p = 0.03) and guided the successful enucleation of each.  The results support the strategy of preoperative PVS and operation with IOUS to localize and remove insulinoma in patients with occult tumors.  Most tumors (75%) will be correctly localized to a specific pancreatic region by preoperative PVS and identified by IOUS (83%), allowing simple enucleation and biochemical correction of hypoglycemia.  Morbid blind pancreatic resections are no longer indicated and long-term medical management of hypoglycemia should be reserved for the occasional patient (8%) who fails preoperative PVS and operation guided by IOUS.",3
Porta hepatis disruption from blunt trauma.  Extrahepatic porta hepatis injuries from blunt abdominal trauma are exceedingly rare; all recently reported cases involve disruption of the common bile duct at its intrapancreatic portion.  We herein report a patient with lacerations of the proper hepatic artery and bile duct occurring from deceleration/torsion of the porta hepatis after high speed vehicular collision.,20
"Relationship of glucocorticoid dosage to serum bone Gla-protein concentration in patients with rheumatologic disorders.  Serum bone Gla-protein (BGP) measurements in 50 rheumatic disease patients receiving long-term prednisone therapy revealed an inverse relationship (r = -0.71, P less than 0.001) between serum BGP levels and prednisone dosage.  Multiple regression analysis demonstrated significant relationships (R2 = 0.72, P less than 0.001) between serum BGP1/2 and prednisone dosage, dosage2, serum creatinine, age, and an age-creatinine interaction.  This model predicts the suppression of serum BGP with low dosages of steroids and 50% suppression with dosages of 20-25 mg/day.",4
"Effects of tracheal irritation and hypercapnia on tracheal smooth muscle in humans.  Both hypercapnia and tracheal irritation are known to constrict the airways in animals.  To see whether similar responses occur in humans, we investigated tracheal smooth muscle (TSM) responses to hypercapnia and tracheal irritation with water in 14 paralyzed and anesthetized humans.  TSM tone was monitored by measuring the pressure in the saline-filled cuff of the endotracheal tube.  Although, tracheal irritation caused TSM constriction in 10 of 14 patients, 4 patients showed no TSM response.  Administration of intravenous atropine attenuated the TSM constriction response.  Hypercapnia did not cause any change in TSM tone in any of the 14 patients.  These results indicate that in paralyzed and anesthetized humans, there exist interindividual differences in the TSM responses to tracheal irritation and that hypercapnia cannot be an effective stimulus for the TSM constriction.",22
"Percutaneous excimer laser coronary angioplasty.  To determine the efficacy of percutaneous excimer laser coronary angioplasty as an adjunct or alternative to conventional balloon angioplasty, 55 patients were studied in a multicenter trial.  These patients underwent the procedure using a modification of conventional balloon angioplasty technique.  A first-generation, 1.6-mm diameter catheter constructed of 12 individual silica fibers concentrically arranged around a guidewire lumen was used.  Catheter tip energy density varied from 35 to 50 mJ/mm2.  The mean number of pulses delivered at 20 Hz was 1,272 +/- 1,345.  Acute success was defined as a greater than or equal to 20% increase in stenotic diameter and a lumen of greater than or equal to 1 mm in diameter after laser treatment.  Acute success was achieved in 46 of 55 (84%) patients.  Adjunctive balloon angioplasty was performed on 41 patients (75%).  The percent diameter stenosis as determined by quantitative angiography decreased from a baseline of 83 +/- 14 to 49 +/- 11% after laser treatment and to 38 +/- 12% in patients undergoing adjunctive balloon angioplasty.  The mean minimal stenotic diameter increased from a baseline of 0.5 +/- 0.4 to 1.6 +/- 0.5 mm after laser treatment and to 2.1 +/- 0.5 mm after balloon angioplasty.  There were no deaths and no vascular perforations.  One patient (1.8%) required emergency coronary bypass surgery.  These data suggest that excimer laser energy delivered percutaneously by specially constructed catheters can safely ablate atheroma and reduce coronary stenoses.",13
"Bidirectional incompatibility between conspecific populations of Drosophila simulans   Cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) describes the phenomenon whereby eggs fertilized by sperm from insects infected with a rickettsial endosymbiont fail to hatch.  Unidirectional CI between conspecific populations of insects is a well documented phenomenon.  Bidirectional CI has, however, only been described in mosquito populations, and recently between closely related species of parasitic wasps, where it is of interest as both an unusual form of reproductive isolation and as a potential means of insect population suppression.  Here we report on the first known example of bidirectional CI between conspecific populations of Drosophila simulans.  Further, we show that defects as early as the first cleavage division are associated with CI.  This observation suggests that the cellular basis of CI involves disruption of processes before or during zygote formation and that CI arises from defects in the structure and/or function of the sperm during fertilization.",11
"William Glenn lecture. The cavopulmonary shunt. Evolution of a concept.  A bold and imaginative development, the cavopulmonary anastomosis, appeared to originate in several centers almost simultaneously.  After extensive research on right heart bypass, Glenn was the first in North America to perform a successful experimental cavopulmonary shunt, and it became known by his name.  In properly selected patients, palliation success was excellent, and mortality rates were low.  From 1961 through 1988, we used a cavopulmonary anastomosis for palliation in 139 infants and children.  There were eight hospital deaths, and most occurred early in the series.  Palliation generally lasted 6-8 years-until the child outgrew the blood supply to the contralateral lung.  Palliation could be restored by increased flow to that lung with another shunt.  Six otherwise inoperable patients received benefit from the addition of an axillary arteriovenous fistula.  Late pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas were identified in 11% of our patients by angiography, but with more sensitive testing, the incidence rate may be as high as 21%.  The occurrence of pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas caused general concern and less frequent use of the shunt.  Recent application of an end-to-side anastomosis, creating a bidirectional shunt, has restored interest.  A major legacy of the cavopulmonary anastomosis was demonstration of the feasibility of partial right heart bypass, which paved the way for the Fontan operation, and it is frequently constructed as part of that operation.  Currently, the Glenn shunt is most often used as a temporary or permanent alternative to a Fontan repair if there appears to be significant risk.  The risk factors usually encountered include small pulmonary arteries, young age, poor ventricular function, atrioventricular valve incompetence, and myocardial hypertrophy-sometimes alone but often in combination.",15
"A comparison of hospital costs and morbidity between octogenarians and other patients undergoing general surgical operations.  The hospital costs and clinical results of 304 patients who were more than 80 years old and who underwent general surgical procedures were evaluated.  The over-all mortality rate was 14 per cent; 19.9 per cent occurred in patients admitted under emergency conditions as compared with 8.9 per cent that occurred in patients undergoing elective procedures (p less than 0.001).  Seventy-nine per cent of the patients were discharged and 7 per cent required care in a skilled nursing facility.  Survival rates were as good or better than standard life table survival rates for 80 year old patients.  Costs were higher in those who were admitted under emergent conditions or who died in the hospital.  Deaths were a result of complications of the primary disease rather than associated disease in most groups.  Neither costs nor length of stay could accurately predict survival of individual patients.  We concluded that health resources should be directed at treating problems, such as cholelithiasis, hernia or carcinoma, early before complications develop.",22
"Abnormal bleeding in the climacteric.  In the perimenopausal years, we encounter a situation where the normal diminution in reproductive capacity, with its resulting disruption of the normal menstrual hormonal pattern, coincides with a very real risk of pelvic pathology.  Limitation in the ability to diagnose and to treat these patients conservatively has in the past resulted in a high rate of hysterectomy.  With increased understanding of the normal physiology of this stage of transition and with improved diagnostic tools, we are now able to come to a definitive diagnosis in most patients.  This ability to assure the diagnosis has made it much easier to counsel the patient confidently about the appropriate course of action.  We will continue to encounter the problem of hysterectomy for bleeding with no histologic lesion being found.  Although reviewers' letters may be considered an unnecessary thorn in the side, the improved practice that has resulted from these efforts gives strong support to their continued activities.  We can have confidence that our treatment plan evolved in a logical manner and offers our patients a high probability of benefit at justifiable risk.",12
"Comparison of SPECT using technetium-99m agents and thallium-201 and PET for the assessment of myocardial perfusion and viability.  This report reviews the applications of tomographic imaging with current and new tracers in assessing myocardial perfusion and viability.  Multiple studies with thallium-201 (TI-201) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging for the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) have demonstrated high sensitivity, high rates of normalcy and high reproducibility.  In assessing viability, fixed defects are frequently detected in viable zones in 4-hour studies with TI-201 imaging.  Redistribution imaging performed 18 to 72 hours after injection or reinjection of TI-201 before 4-hour redistribution imaging has been shown to improve accuracy of viability assessment.  TI-201 SPECT studies are limited by the suboptimal physical properties of TI-201, which result in variable image quality.  The 2 new technetium-99m (Tc-99m) - labeled myocardial perfusion tracers offer the ability to inject much higher amounts of radioactivity, making it possible to assess ventricular function as well as myocardial perfusion from the same injection of radiotracer.  Tc-99m sestamibi has very slow myocardial clearance, which allows for prolonged imaging time and results in image quality superior to that obtained with TI-201 and Tc-99m teboroxime.  The combination of minimal redistribution of Tc-99m sestamibi and high count rates makes gated SPECT imaging feasible, and also permits assessment of patients with acute ischemic syndromes by uncoupling the time of injection from the time of imaging.  The combination of high image quality and first-pass exercise capabilities may lead to a choice of this agent over TI-201 for assessment of chronic CAD.",13
"Full-length recombinant CD4 and recombinant gp120 inhibit fusion between HIV infected macrophages and uninfected CD4-expressing T-lymphoblastoid cells.  Human immunodeficiency virus-(HIV) infected monocyte-macrophages may contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV-associated immune deficiency and dysfunction by acting as a target and potential reservoir for the virus in vivo, and by functioning abnormally following infection.  We have shown that HIV-infected macrophages fuse with uninfected CD4-expressing lymphoid cells in vitro; this may provide an additional mechanism for CD4 lymphocyte depletion in vivo.  We report here the inhibition of syncytium formation between HIV-infected macrophages and uninfected CD4-expressing T-lymphoid cells by monoclonal antibody S3.5, directed against an epitope of CD4 involved in binding HIV gp120, by a recombinant protein that comprises the full-length extracellular domain of the CD4 molecule, and by recombinant full-length HIV envelope glycoprotein, gp120.  These results indicate that both molecules (gp120 and CD4) are critical to the fusion process, and suggest that gp120 is expressed on the surface of HIV-infected monocyte-macrophages.",19
"Comparison of pathological lesions on repeated renal biopsies in 73 patients with primary IgA glomerulonephritis: value of quantitative scoring and approach to final prognosis.  In order to improve our possibility of establishing a long-term prognosis in IgA nephritis, 73 patients out of a cohort of 282, followed over a mean period of 12 years at the same institution for an IgA nephritis, had a prospective second renal biopsy 5 years later.  For all biopsies (RB1 and RB2), we developed a quantitative scoring for all elementary lesions with a glomerular, an interstitial, a tubular and a vascular index.  The sum of these 4 indexes gave a global optical score (GOS).  Pathological improvement on light microscopy (delta GOS less than or equal to -2) was noticed only in 3 patients (4%), stability (-2 less than delta GOS less than +2) in 30 patients (41%), mild deterioration (+2 less than or equal to GOS less than 5) in 23 patients (32%) and major progression (delta GOS greater than or equal to 5) in 17 patients (23%).  We observed no pathological remission, even in the 14 patients with complete clinical remission.  The pathological progression was characterized by an increase in all elementary lesions, mainly the tubulo-interstitial and vascular ones.  By immunofluorescence mesangial IgA deposits remained stable with no disappearance; however, the number and intensity of vascular C3 deposits were significantly greater on RB2.  Chronic renal failure (serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dl) correlated best with major pathological progression and mainly with the progression of extraglomerular lesions.  IgA nephritis is a slowly progressive disease with no pathological remission, and its evolution is characterized by progression of extraglomerular lesions, mainly vascular, which might play a major role in the ultimate development of chronic renal failure.",11
"Enhanced percutaneous absorption of a novel topical cyclosporin A formulation and assessment of its immunosuppressive activity.  No clinically successful topical cyclosporin A (CyA) formulation has been produced, mainly due to the apparent lack of drug penetration.  This study has produced the first in vitro kinetic data on CyA penetration across human cadaver stratum corneum and has shown that addition of the penetration enhancers (PE) Azone and propylene glycol to the CyA vehicle significantly enhanced drug permeation across the skin barrier.  Using flow-through permeability cells with 5% w/v CyA (Sandimmun) alone (CyA) or with PE (CyA + PE) in olive oil in the donor chamber, the penetration rate (mean +/- SD microgram/cm2/h) into receptor fluid was 53 +/- 43 (n = 13) for CyA and 660 +/- 175 (n = 7) for CyA + PE.  The in vivo efficacy of this formulation was assessed in guinea-pigs undergoing delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions to dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB).  CyA was applied topically at the time of challenge and twice daily thereafter.  At 24 h, skin reactions revealed that compared with appropriate drug vehicles, concentrations of 0.25, 0.5 and 5% CyA +/- PE had a significant inhibitory effect upon the erythema response and this corresponded with significant reductions in T-cell infiltrates (0.5 and 5% CyA).  No statistically significant reductions in erythema were demonstrated with 0.05% CyA +/- PE, but there was a reduction in the number of infiltrating lymphocytes in sites receiving 0.05% CyA + PE compared with vehicle-treated sites (P less than 0.01).  This suggests that PE permitted some penetration of an otherwise non-immunosuppressive concentration of CyA through the skin.",19
"Submersion in The Netherlands: prognostic indicators and results of resuscitation.  STUDY OBJECTIVES: To analyze prognostic indicators and the outcome of resuscitation in submersion victims (drowning and near drowning).  DESIGN: Retrospective study.  SETTING: Intensive and Respiratory Care Unit.  Between January 1, 1979, and December 31, 1985, 87 submersion victims were admitted.  The files of 83 victims were available for statistical analysis.  There were 66 male victims and 17 female victims; the average age was 31.4 +/- 25.8 years.  There were ten salt water and 73 fresh water submersions.  MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Predictors for better survival potentials were a young age, submersion of less than ten minutes, no signs of aspiration, and a central body temperature of less than 35 C at admission.  We did not detect factors that accelerated a decrease in core body temperature at admission and assume that lethal hypoxia had preceded protective hypothermia in our submersion victims.  The Orlowski score had a predictive value but at the same time we found nonindependent indicators in this score.  Neurologic outcome in our patients, who were not treated according to a brain protection protocol, was not worse than the outcome published by authors who have used such a protocol.  Thirty-three percent of the victims with a cardioventilatory arrest (15) and all victims with a ventilatory arrest (11) survived resuscitation and were discharged.  Five nonarrest victims died due to late complications.  CONCLUSION: This study shows that no indicator at the rescue site and in the hospital is absolutely reliable with respect to death or survival.",20
"Effects of low perfusate Ca2+ concentration on newborn myocardial function after ischemia.  A greater dependence on transsarcolemmal Ca2+ flux and immaturity of Ca2+ sequestration capacity may potentiate Ca2(+)-mediated reperfusion injury in the newborn myocardium.  The effect of serum ionized Ca2+ concentration on left ventricular systolic and diastolic function after ischemia was studied in 5-7-day-old piglets undergoing a 90-minute period of cold-blood cardioplegic arrest.  In the control group, Ca2+ was maintained at 1.2 mM (Group A [n = 6]).  The cardioplegic solution and bypass perfusate were modified to achieve a low Ca2+ concentration, 0.25 mM, in Group B (n = 6).  Left ventricular pressure-volume loops were acquired by using high-fidelity pressure-sensor-tipped and volume-conductance catheters.  Ventricular function was assessed from the slope of end-systolic (Ees) and end-diastolic (k) pressure-volume relations during transient caval occlusion.  Both groups showed a significant reduction in Ees after ischemia (p less than 0.05).  Intergroup comparison of Ees after ischemia demonstrated a better recovery of the systolic function in the low Ca2+ group, 64 +/- 7% versus 49 +/- 6% in the normal Ca2+ group (p = 0.05).  There was a significant increase in chamber stiffness index in group A (k, 0.48 +/- 0.06 to 0.65 +/- 0.05 ml-1, p less than 0.01) versus no significant change in group B.  This study shows 1) the feasibility of acquiring continuous pressure-volume data in neonatal hearts by using a conductance catheter system, and 2) better preservation of systolic function and diastolic compliance in normal newborn myocardium by low Ca2+ concentration in the peri-ischemic period.",13
"Melanoma and soft tissue sarcoma in seven patients.  Seven patients with both melanoma and sarcoma were seen at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute (Boston, MA) over a 4-year period.  Three had additional malignant neoplasms; one of these patients also had the hereditary cutaneous malignant melanoma, dysplastic nevus syndrome.  These observations suggest the possibility of a biologic relationship between melanoma and sarcoma, the nature of which remains unknown.",3
"Cold follicles in a multinodular human goiter arise partly from a failing iodide pump and partly from deficient iodine organification.  To investigate whether the common cold follicles in human multinodular goiters are the consequence of a functional defect of the apical membrane peroxidase, a failure of the iodide transport system, or both deficiencies, we studied iodide accumulation and iodine organification in 30 fragments of a large multinodular goiter transplanted to nude mice and labeled with 125I.  Transplants were frozen to -80 C immediately after removal to avoid diffusion of inorganic iodide.  Autoradiographic assessment of over 1000 cryosections (exposed either at -20 C or after thawing and washing out unbound iodide) showed two types of cold follicles, namely those that failed to accumulate iodide and, therefore, did not organify iodine, and those that readily accumulated iodide but failed to bind it, suggesting a failure of apical membrane peroxidase.  The two types of pathogenetically different cold follicles coexisted in an apparently randomly intermingled fashion throughout the whole goiter.",18
"Ultrasonic evaluation of early carotid atherosclerosis.  We investigated the prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis, including mild early lesions, and its association with cervical bruits and various risk factors (age, male sex, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and cigarette smoking) in 232 consecutive Japanese patients.  High-resolution real-time B-mode ultrasonography was performed to determine the extent of atherosclerosis, and it was quantified by using a scoring system.  The prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis was 49%, 59%, and 41% in all 232 patients, the 100 symptomatic patients, and the 132 asymptomatic patients, respectively.  Although carotid lesions were detected frequently (87%) in the 30 patients with cervical bruits, bruits were noted in only 30% of the 88 examined patients with carotid atherosclerosis.  Independent risk factors for carotid atherosclerosis in these patients were found to be age, male sex, and hyperlipidemia; diabetes mellitus was a possible risk factor for carotid atherosclerosis.  Our study did not show a close association between hypertension and carotid atherosclerosis, and this might be caused by the high prevalence of hypertension in our patients.  Our findings suggest an increasing prevalence of carotid atherosclerosis in the Japanese, though this should be confirmed in a population-based study.  Our study demonstrates the clinical usefulness of high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography for the evaluation of early carotid atherosclerosis.",13
"Differences in lipoprotein subfraction composition and distribution between type I diabetic men and control subjects.  Subfractions of very-low-density and low-density lipoproteins were examined in 10 male normolipidemic type I (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients before and after improvement of metabolic control and were compared with subfractions from male control subjects matched to the diabetic patients at entry for age, body mass index, plasma cholesterol, and plasma triglycerides.  Two consistent differences in subfraction composition were noted between the diabetic patients at entry and the control subjects.  First, subfractions from diabetic patients tended to be cholesterol-ester poor and triglyceride rich; this was particularly marked for the low-density lipoprotein subfractions.  Second, the subfractions from pretreatment diabetic patients contained higher proportions of non-apolipoprotein B apolipoproteins.  This compositional anomaly, but not the lipid modifications, responded to but was not completely normalized by improved glycemic control, which was also accompanied by reductions in the plasma concentrations of all subfractions.  Treatment modified subfraction distribution so that the lipoprotein profile of posttreatment diabetic patients more closely resembled the profile observed in the control subjects.  These changes were achieved without significant modification of daily insulin dose.  In the context of blood lipid risk factors, the results argue for the need to maintain optimal insulinization even in apparently normolipidemic diabetic patients to avoid modifications of the lipoprotein pattern toward a potentially more atherogenic profile.",17
"Desmopressin and antifibrinolytics.  Desmopressin appears to be a safe and effective hemostatic agent for use during surgery in patients with mild to moderate hemophilia or von Willebrand disease.  Uremic patients also benefit from substitution of desmopressin for cryoprecipitate to control bleeding.  The highly variable response to desmopressin by individual patients with hemophilia or von Willebrand disease dictates that each patient receive a trial administration prior to surgery; surgery should proceed only following verification of a therapeutically effective increase in Factor VIII and vWF after desmopressin.  Use of desmopressin in patients with normal baseline hemostatic function is not clearly advantageous, although certain patient subgroups might benefit, and prospective studies have documented the drug's safety in these cases.  Data are lacking to clarify a role for desmopressin during surgery in patients taking aspirin.  Antifibrinolytic therapy appears to decrease bleeding without increased risk after cardiac surgery.  In addition, specific use after urological surgery may be beneficial in the absence of upper urinary tract bleeding.  In the last ten years, other applications for antifibrinolytic therapy have been found--both surgical (intracranial aneurysms, oral and lacrimal surgery) and nonsurgical (in cancer patients and for gastrointestinal bleeding).  Although anecdotal reports have fueled fears of increased thrombosis with antifibrinolytics, controlled studies indicate no increased risk.",22
"Effect of vaccination on serotype-specific antibody responses in infants administered WC3 bovine rotavirus before or after a natural rotavirus infection.  In an evaluation of WC3 bovine rotavirus (serotype 6) vaccine in infants, some subjects experienced a natural serotype 1 rotavirus infection before vaccination and others after.  Therefore, the effects of both WC3 and natural rotavirus strains as either primary or boosting immunogens on serotype-specific neutralizing antibody responses could be determined.  After primary natural infection (symptomatic or asymptomatic), neutralizing antibody titers were highest to serotype 1 but were consistently high to serotype 3, and low titers (greater than or equal to 20) to serotypes 2 and 4 were often detected.  Previous vaccination with WC3 had little effect on the magnitude of these responses.  In contrast, subjects infected with serotype 1 strains before vaccination experienced large (average, 12-fold) rises in neutralizing antibody to human serotypes 1-4 when vaccinated with WC3.  Thus, although WC3 and the natural strains are distinct serotypes, their epitopes were sufficiently similar that reinfection with WC3 could boost neutralizing antibody titers to human serotypes in subjects primed by a previous natural infection.",1
"Cartilage begets bone versus endochondral myelopoiesis.  Observations on the cellular events involved in embryonic long-bone formation, ectopic osteogenesis, fracture repair, and the analysis of mesenchymal stem-cell potential provide evidence of the intimate and direct relationship of osteogenesis to angiogenesis and vasculature.  The sequence of cellular events is that cartilage is not replaced by bone but, rather, is a target for vascularization and myelopoiesis.  With this in mind, it may be necessary to replace the term ""endochondral bone formation"" with ""endochondral myelopoiesis."".",20
"A specific in vitro bioassay for measuring erythropoietin levels in human serum and plasma.  The accurate measurement of biologically active erythropoietin (Ep) in human serum and plasma using present in vivo and in vitro bioassays is difficult because of the presence of both inhibitors and non-Ep stimulators of erythropoiesis.  We have developed a simple procedure to quantitatively purify Ep from serum and plasma for subsequent testing in the phenylhydrazine-treated mouse spleen cell assay.  The method involves absorption of Ep to an immobilized high-affinity anti-Ep monoclonal antibody and acid elution of the antibody-bound material.  After neutralization, the eluted EP is then tested directly in the in vitro bioassay without interference by other serum proteins.  By using magnetic beads as a solid support for the antibody, washing and elution steps can be performed rapidly and efficiently.  Recoveries of Ep after this procedure show very little sample-to-sample variation and are consistently between 45% and 55%, which is close to the maximum binding expected for the anti-Ep antibody.  Coupled with the 7.4-fold concentration that this procedure affords, there is an overall increase in sensitivity of three- to fourfold, which makes this assay suitable for accurately measuring Ep levels in patients with below-average titers.  Results with this magnetic bead assay indicate that accurate and reproducible estimates for Ep levels in the serum and plasma from healthy donors as well as from patients with hematologic disorders can be obtained.  Titers of biologically active Ep in the sera from a group of patients with either leukemia or lymphoma were found to be elevated, and the values correlated well with titers of immunoreactive Ep measured in the Ep radioimmunoassay.  Because of its specificity and high sensitivity, the magnetic bead assay is a valuable alternative to immunoassays for the measurement of elevated, normal, and even subnormal Ep levels in human serum and plasma.",14
"Effects of thoracic epidural anesthesia on coronary arteries and arterioles in patients with coronary artery disease.  The effect of cardiac sympathetic blockade by high thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA) (T1-T6, bupivacaine) on the luminal diameter of normal and diseased portions of epicardial coronary arteries was determined by quantitative coronary angiography in patients (n = 27) with severe coronary artery disease (CAD).  In a separate group of patients (n = 9) with severe CAD, the effects of TEA on coronary arterioles (resistance vessels) were studied, by measuring total and regional myocardial blood flow and metabolism with the retrograde coronary sinus thermodilution technique.  At the stenotic segments, TEA induced an increase in luminal diameter from 1.34 +/- 0.11 to 1.56 +/- 0.13 mm (P less than 0.002), but did not change the diameter of the nonstenotic segments (3.07 +/- 0.13 to 2.99 +/- 0.13 mm).  In the second group of patients, TEA induced no changes in coronary perfusion pressure, total or regional myocardial blood flow, coronary venous oxygen content, coronary blood flow distribution, regional myocardial oxygen consumption, or lactate extraction or uptake.  Two patients had chest pain in the control situation and had regional myocardial lactate production that was attenuated by TEA.  We conclude that TEA may increase the diameter of stenotic epicardial coronary artery segments in patients with CAD without causing a dilation of coronary arterioles.  These effects may be beneficial when high TEA is used to treat severe ischemic chest pain in patients at rest.",13
"HIV disease: a review for the family physician. Part I. Evaluation and conventional therapy.  Family physicians will be challenged with caring for increasing numbers of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus.  After confirming the presence of the infection, the physician must follow a logical sequence of evaluation, counseling and treatment.  The current Centers for Disease Control classification and a series of evaluation and treatment protocols form the basis for prescribing zidovudine to delay or mitigate involvement of T lymphocytes and neuronal cells.",19
"Evolution of deep venous thrombosis: a prospective evaluation with US.  Forty-six patients with a diagnosis of acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) established by means of duplex ultrasound (US) were prospectively followed up with serial duplex US examinations during a 6-month period to assess the persistence of venous abnormalities.  All patients were asymptomatic.  Isolated popliteal DVT was found to be more likely to revert to normal at duplex compression US than thrombosis involving both the femoral and popliteal systems (P less than .05).  Increased venous diameter was a sign of acute clot (P less than .005).  Clot echogenicity did not help to enable distinction of acute DVT and chronic DVT.  At compression US, 10 of 21 patients (48%) who initially had occlusive thrombosis had persistent abnormalities that mimicked findings consistent with acute DVT.  Chronic venous changes that persisted after 6 months consisted of either lumen recanalization (with resultant intimal thickening) or persistent venous occlusion.  Both of these conditions can result in incomplete compression, the major US indication of acute DVT.  This appearance should not be confused with that of acute DVT.  Follow-up examinations to establish a baseline appearance can be obtained as early as 6 months after an acute episode of DVT.",13
"The effect of post-pubertal varicocele on testicular volume.  Paediatric varicocele is a well known entity but its effect on adult infertility has not been adequately clarified.  Since measurement of testicular volume is currently the best method of estimating the male reproductive potential, 945 boys aged between 13 and 18 years were examined with regard to testicular volume and the incidence of varicocele.  The average volumes for right and left testes were 15.087 +/- 0.237 and 14.514 +/- 0.347 ml respectively, and the incidence of varicocele was 16.7%.  The incidence increased from 14.5 to 21.7% as the ages increased from 14 to 18.  The differences in volume of the 2 testes in boys with varicocele were statistically significant when compared with the normal group, but this significance failed to become more pronounced when the slight varicocele group (grade I) was included with the normal group and compared with the severe varicocele group (grades II and III).  There may be no significant differences between the volumes of the 2 testes in boys with varicocele when careful measurement and strict statistical analyses are applied.  However, some boys in the varicocele group were found to have testicular volumes below the confidence interval (mean - SE) or under 1 SD, and the 2 testicular volumes differed in certain age groups.  This group requires further follow-up.  The results of this study have added further contradictory findings to the issue of paediatric varicocele in terms of testicular atrophy, estimation of potential fertility and the indications for immediate surgery.  There is a need for further prospective controlled trials.",11
"Treatment of adult chickenpox with oral acyclovir.  Thirty-one late adolescents and adults with varicella were studied.  Patients identified within 72 hours of varicella exanthem were offered open treatment with acyclovir (4 g/d), and those patients identified after 72 hours of exanthem were followed up but not treated.  Twenty-two patients were treated with acyclovir.  Nine patients were not treated.  No severe complications occurred in any of the 31 patients.  Minor complications, including prolonged fever, localized secondary infections, persistent cough, and prolonged fatigue were more frequent in the untreated group.  If the acyclovir therapy was begun within the first 24 hours of varicella exanthem, then the rash and clinical illness were dramatically lessened.  Treatment with oral acyclovir should be considered for varicella in adults who are identified within the first 24 hours of exanthem.",1
"Fascinating rhythm: a primer on chaos theory and its application to cardiology.  Nonlinear dynamics is an exciting new way of looking at peculiarities that in the past have been ignored or explained away.  We have attempted to give a general introduction to the basics of the mathematics, applications to cardiology, and a brief review of the new tools needed to use the concepts of nonlinear mathematics.  The careful mathematical approach to problems in cardiac electrical dynamics and blood flow is opening a window on behaviors and mechanisms previously inaccessible.",22
"Differential regulation of human immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs): a specific regulatory element in HIV-2 responds to stimulation of the T-cell antigen receptor.  The human immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs) types 1 and 2 have similar genetic organization but differ significantly in nucleic acid sequence.  Although infection by either agent leads to symptoms of immunodeficiency, recent studies suggest potential differences in the time course and severity of these diseases.  In this report, the transcriptional regulation and induction of these retroviruses were analyzed.  We report that the regulation of HIV-2 differs from that of HIV-1: a distinct T-cell activation pathway, triggering of the CD3 component of the T-cell receptor complex, stimulates HIV-2 but not HIV-1 gene expression.  The response to T-cell receptor stimulation in HIV-2 is mediated partly by an upstream regulatory element, termed CD3R, which is recognized by a sequence-specific DNA binding protein, NF-CD3R.  Jurkat T leukemia cell lines containing HIV-2 provirus also showed increased viral replication after stimulation of the T-cell receptor complex, in contrast to HIV-1.  These findings suggest that transcriptional regulation and induction of HIV-2 differ from HIV-1 and raise the possibility that different cofactors contribute to the activation of HIV-1- and HIV-2-associated AIDS.",22
"Blunt trauma to the heart: the pathophysiology of injury.  Blunt injuries to the heart are common and potentially lethal.  These injuries often go undetected while more obvious problems are treated.  A cardiac injury should be suspected in any patient who sustains severe chest trauma.  The spectrum of cardiac trauma ranges from injuries with no actual cellular damage (myocardial concussion) to cardiac chamber rupture.  The pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of these injuries are discussed.",20
"Platelet activating factor-induced clinical and histopathologic responses in atopic skin and their modification by the platelet activating factor antagonist BN52063.  The clinical and histopathologic responses to intradermal platelet-activating factor (PAF-acether) in atopic subjects, without evidence of atopic dermatitis are documented.  An immediate acute wheal and flare reaction was observed in all volunteers.  Histopathologically, the reaction was characterized by a predominantly neutrophilic response, which was seen at 30 minutes and was maximal at 4 hours.  Eosinophils were observed in the infiltrate as early as 30 minutes after injection, and were maximal by 12 hours.  The specific PAF-acether antagonist BN52063 antagonized the acute flare response to intradermal PAF-acether but had little effect on cellular recruitment at the site of injection.",19
"Left ventricular fibroma: echocardiographic diagnosis and successful surgical excision in three cases.  The management of three patients with left ventricular fibromas is outlined.  All were asymptomatic children.  Routine chest radiography suggested cardiac masses.  M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography were valuable adjuncts to conventional angiography in assessing these children.  Electrocardiographic changes, present in all cases, were shown to regress postoperatively.  We stress the importance of these noninvasive aids in the initial investigation and outline our operative methods of reconstruction.",3
Tension pneumopericardium as a complication of single-lung transplantation.  Tension pneumopericardium is distinctly uncommon in the adult population.

"Home treatment for acute psychiatric illness   OBJECTIVE--To determine the factors influencing the successful outcome of community treatment for severe acute psychiatric illnesses that are traditionally treated in hospital.  DESIGN--All patients from a single electoral ward who were either admitted to hospital or treated at home over a two year period (1 October 1987 to 30 September 1989) were included in the study and their case notes audited.  The second year of the study is reported.  SETTING--Electoral ward of Sparkbrook, Birmingham.  SUBJECTS--99 Patients aged 16-65 with severe acute psychiatric illness.  RESULTS--65 Patients were managed by home treatment alone; 34 required admission to hospital.  The location of treatment was significantly (all p less than 0.05) influenced by social characteristics of the patients (marital state, age (in men), ethnicity, and living alone) and by characteristics of the referral (occurring out of hours; assessment taking place at hospital or police station).  DSM-III-R diagnosis was more weakly associated with outcome.  Violence during the episode was significantly related to admission, although deliberate self harm was not.  CONCLUSIONS--Home treatment is feasible for most patients with acute psychiatric illness.  A 24 hour on call assessment service increases the likelihood of success because admission is determined more strongly by social characteristics of the patient and the referral than by illness factors.  Admission will still be required for some patients.  A locally based mental health resource centre, a 24 hour on call service, an open referral system, and an active follow up policy increase the effectiveness of a home treatment service.",22
"Individualizing treatment of vaginal candidiasis.  Clinicians have a vast array of effective antimycotics for the treatment of vaginal candidiasis.  Multiple topical formulations are available, yet there is little evidence to suggest that formulation per se influences outcome.  A growing number of highly effective oral systemic antimycotic agents provide the practitioner with additional options.  Treatment regimens have also changed with the introduction of shorter, often single-day/single-dose courses of therapy.  Not all therapeutic agents have the same activity against vaginal fungal pathogens in that topical azoles tend to be more active than nystatin.  Differences in patient characteristics, however, are more important than the differences between antimycotic agents and therapeutic regimens in determining selection of the appropriate antimycotic.  Patients with vaginal candidiasis vary with regard to duration and severity of symptoms and past frequency of attacks, distribution of inflammation, and pregnancy status.  The clinician should consider all these variables both in selecting the appropriate antimycotic agent and the route of administration and in planning the duration of therapy.  Individualized therapy offers additional benefits to patients, who may then enjoy the maximum advantages of antimycotics now available.",0
"Recovery of morphine from a controlled-release preparation. A source of opioid abuse.  MS-Contin (Purdue-Fredrick, Norwalk, CT) is a controlled-release preparation of morphine sulfate that has demonstrated efficacy in the management of chronic cancer pain problems.  It has recently come to the attention of the authors that MS-Contin represents a potential source of opioid abuse through the extraction and intravenous injection of the morphine from this preparation.  The authors describe a simple aqueous extraction method that was used to quantitatively determine the extent to which morphine could be obtained from MS-Contin tablets.",20
"Aging and the skin: recognizing and managing common disorders.  Senescent changes in structure and function of the skin and chronic solar radiation damage predispose the skin of the elderly to certain inflammatory and infectious diseases.

"Adjuvant chemotherapy for primary lymphoma of the central nervous system.  Ten immunocompetent patients with primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the central nervous system were treated by the neuro-oncology service at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF).  After undergoing surgery for biopsy or removal of their tumors, these patients (group 1) received irradiation with hydroxyurea followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with the combination of procarbazine, lomustine (CCNU), and vincristine.  The outcome of treatment in this group was compared with that in three other groups of patients with primary CNS lymphoma: patients treated at the UCSF Cancer Research Institute who underwent surgery and radiation therapy (RT) (group 2); patients described in the literature who had surgery and RT (group 3); or patients described in the literature who had surgery, RT, and chemotherapy (group 4).  Median and quartile survival times were greater in patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy (group 1, 30 and 50 months; group 4, 20 and 25 months) than in patients who did not receive chemotherapy after RT (group 2, 13 and 20 months; group 3, 15 and 24 months).  These results suggest that adjuvant chemotherapy is useful in the treatment of primary CNS lymphoma.",9
"ECMO assisted angioplasty for cardiomyopathy patients with unstable angina.  Patients who are otherwise unsuitable candidates for coronary bypass surgery or standard coronary angioplasty (PTCA) may be successfully treated with PTCA during ECMO.  Five patients (3 men, 2 women), with a mean age of 57 years, are reported on here.  They were not considered good candidates for standard therapy because of poor left ventricular function (mean EF, 24; range, 16 to 28%).  Patients were supported by percutaneous femoral bypass using a BARD CPS machine, and underwent successful PTCA of either two vessels (three patients) or three vessels (two patients); in addition, one patient had dilatation of a stenotic aortic valve.  Patients were supported with ECMO for 26 to 140 (mean 104) minutes, and required transfusion with 0 to 4 (mean 2) units of blood during or after the procedure.  Complications included groin hematoma in two patients.  All were discharged within 4 days of the procedure.  Follow-up of the patients has been completed (4-7 mo) with no further hospitalizations for unstable angina.  All patients remain in NYHA Class II or III.  These data suggest that ECMO-assisted angioplasty is a safe and effective method of palliation of unstable angina associated with cardiomyopathy.",13
"Heterogenous amplification of myc family oncogenes in small cell lung carcinoma.  One hundred forty-two foci of small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) from 47 patients were examined for amplification of myc family oncogenes (c-myc, N-myc, and L-myc), by dot blot hybridization using formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded materials which were resected surgically or obtained at autopsy.  Some selected patients were also examined by in situ hybridization.  Amplification of myc family genes was detected in 11 patients (23.4%) (c-myc in one, N-myc in five, and L-myc in five).  Two of the 11 patients (one with N-myc and one with L-myc) had heterogenously amplified clones.  In the patient with N-myc amplification, amplification was detected in metastatic tumors in the pancreas, lung, and pleura, but not in the liver and lymph node metastases.  In the primary tumor, areas with and without N-myc amplification were seen.  In the patient with L-myc amplification, although amplification was not detected in the surgically resected primary lesion, mediastinal lymph node metastatic lesions obtained at autopsy showed L-myc gene amplification.  These two cases, together with previously reported evidence, suggest that myc gene amplification plays an important role in malignant progression, rather than development, of SCLC.  In Stage III and IV groups, patients with over ten-fold myc gene amplification were suggested to survive for a shorter time than patients without such amplification (P = 0.06).",7
"Normal small bowel biopsy followed by coeliac disease.  We report four patients (two children, one adolescent, and one adult) having normal small bowel mucosa shown on a biopsy specimen taken before the initial diagnosis of coeliac disease was made.  The first biopsy was undertaken in two cases because of suspected malabsorption, in the third because of suspected dermatitis herpetiformis, and in the fourth as part of a coeliac disease family study.  After a further 2.6 to 9 years on a diet containing gluten, small bowel villous atrophy with crypt hyperplasia compatible with coeliac disease was found on a second biopsy specimen.  The HLA type of the patients was that typical for coeliac disease; all were DR3 positive.  Within the families three other patients with coeliac disease have been diagnosed, two earlier and one at the time the first biopsy was undertaken.  Four other HLA-DR3 positive haploidentical first degree relatives were found and had biopsies.  All four had normal small bowel villous architecture, one had an increased intraepithelial cell count, and another was positive for reticulin and endomysium antibodies.  Coeliac disease may exist latent in patients having normal mucosa when eating a normal diet containing gluten.",5
"Mucinous adenocarcinoma of the submandibular gland.  A rare tumor not easily classifiable among published histologic categories for salivary gland tumors is reported.  The neoplasm developed within the submandibular gland of a 78-year-old woman with invasion of the mandible and metastasis to regional lymph nodes.  Histopathologically, cuboidal cells possessing clear cytoplasm and displaced round nuclei proliferated and exhibited an adenomatous pattern.  Many cystic spaces surrounded by tumor cell strands were seen, mucus substance filled in the cystic spaces, and the tumor cells seemed mucus-secreting, but neither epidermoid cells nor papillary appearance could be observed.  Electromicroscopically, numerous mucous droplets of low electron density were prominent in the cytoplasm, and the tumor cells had sparse irregular microvilli on the luminal surface.  Mucin histochemistry, including paradoxical concanavalin A staining, revealed that the tumor cells contained neutral and acid mucins, and these were identified as class II and III mucosubstances.  No other neoplastic lesion, except recurrent metastatic neck nodes, has been detected 6 years after the first examination, and it seems that the tumor is a rare primary mucinous adenocarcinoma of the submandibular gland.",3
"Surgical treatment for secondary retracted nose.  This surgical technique is presented to correct nasal tip retraction, which is frequently associated with other surgical sequelae that can be corrected simultaneously.  It is based on the use of a shield, an anchor, or half an anchor of otocartilage, with one or two posterior supports that are sutured together forming a small L and are fixed to the bed to project the nasal tip and, if necessary, to correct the unilateral or bilateral alar collapse.",7
"Incidence of cervical spinal stenosis in professional and rookie football players.  Sagittal canal/vertebral body ratios were measured on cervical spine lateral radiographs of 124 professional football players and 100 rookie football players.  A total of 894 levels were measured in 224 players.  Thirty-two percent (40) of the 124 professional football players, and 34% of the 100 rookies had a ratio of less than 0.80 at one or more levels from C3 to C6.  The 0.80 ratio has been considered indicative of cervical spinal stenosis.  This is the first time that the incidence of spinal stenosis, as determined by Torg's ratio, has been demonstrated in a population of professional and rookie football players.  Because one-third of this population has cervical spinal stenosis as determined by the Torg ratio, other factors should be considered in the evaluation of a player with a transient quadriplegic episode when making continued play decisions.",4
"Effective ultraviolet irradiation of platelet concentrates in teflon bags.  Several plastic materials used in blood storage were evaluated for their ability to transmit ultraviolet B (UVB) light.  A plastic bag manufactured from sheets of transparent Teflon efficiently (78-86%) transmitted UVB light and was employed in subsequent functional studies of lymphocytes and platelets exposed to UVB light while contained in these bags.  In vitro experiments showed a UVB dose-dependent abrogation of lymphocyte responder and stimulator functions, with concurrent preservation of platelet aggregation responses.  In a phase I pilot study, UVB-treated platelet concentrates were administered to four bone marrow transplant recipients.  Adverse effects attributable to the transfusions were not observed, and patients showed clinically effective transfusion responses.  No patient developed lymphocytotoxic HLA or platelet antibodies.  These studies suggest that platelets can be effectively irradiated with UVB light in a closed system.  However, numerous variables, including container material, volume and composition of contents, steady exposure versus agitation, and exact UV wavelength, must be considered.",3
"Malignant rhabdoid tumor of the liver. A distinct clinicopathologic entity.  A malignant rhabdoid tumor occurring as a primary hepatic neoplasm in a six-month-old white infant is reported.  It was treated by an attempt at total resection involving right hepatic lobectomy and by chemotherapy with cis-platinum, VP-16, and Adriamycin.  Despite this, recurrence of the tumor resulted in the girl's death within three months.  The neoplasm showed typical light microscopic features of malignant rhabdoid tumor as well as filamentous cytoplasmic inclusions by electron microscopic examination and staining for both cytokeratin and vimentin by immunohistochemistry.  The classic clinicopathologic features of this tumor support the concept that malignant rhabdoid tumors similar to those of the kidney may occur in extrarenal sites.",3
"The prevalence of periodontitis in a military treatment population.  A group of 1,984 males and females (age range 13 to 84) at a military dental clinic were given oral examinations with full-mouth circumferential periodontal probing.  Diagnoses were made both for individual quadrants and for the entire mouth using clearly defined diagnostic criteria.  The results showed 37% of the subjects had gingivitis only, 33% had early periodontitis, 14% had moderate periodontitis, 15% had advanced periodontitis, 0.5% had juvenile periodontitis, and 0.5% had necrotizing gingivitis.  The prevalence of periodontitis increased with age to a peak in the 45- to 50-year-age group.  The proportion of periodontitis-affected quadrants, although initially lagging behind the overall case diagnoses, also increased with age.",6
"Delirium: masquerades and misdiagnosis in elderly inpatients.  Delirium is an organic mental disorder defined as transient, fluctuating global dysfunction of cognition.  It is common in elderly medical inpatients, yet its varied presentation is often missed or misdiagnosed.",9
"Phenotypic and functional characterization of T cells from patients with myasthenia gravis.  A study of cell surface phenotypes of PBL of myasthenia gravis (MG) patients showed that their T cells had a significantly higher percentage of 4B4+ T cells (the helper/inducer subset) than age- and sex-matched controls.  The PBL of MG patients proliferated significantly higher than those of normal subjects (NS) in response to the purified alpha chain of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR).  Anti-AChR antibody was present in sera of 88% of MG and none of the NS.  The PBL B cells from MG only, when cultured with autologous T cells and stimulated with either pokeweed mitogen (69%), or AChR-alpha chain (38%), secreted antibody to AChR-alpha chain, whereas T and B cells alone secreted no antibody.  T cells from PBL of MG patients were more readily cloned than T cells of NS, by limiting dilution, in the presence of recombinant IL-2 and in the absence of AChR-alpha chain.  About 50% of T cell clones from MG patients, compared to none from NS, proliferated to AChR-alpha chain.  This response was HLA-DR restricted.  MG T cell clones did not display significant cytotoxic activity, as compared to control T cell clones.  Our results indicate that in MG, 4B4+ regulatory T cells play their role in the pathogenesis of MG, not by cytotoxicity, but more likely by their ability to stimulate specific antibody production by B cells.",9
"Management of primary hypothyroidism.  Primary hypothyroidism is a common condition requiring lifelong treatment and monitoring.  The type and amount of thyroid hormone replacement, selection of laboratory tests, and timing of office visits are all important for optimizing patient well-being and reducing the costs of medical care.  The aim of treatment is to bring the patient to the euthyroid state.  Currently this is defined as a normal serum concentration of TSH by recently developed sensitive and specific immunometric assays, and is accomplished by titrating the dose of levothyroxine and changing it not more often than at 4- to 6-week intervals.  As an indicator of euthyroidism, the sensitive TSH assay has advantages over tests of serum T4, FT4I, T3, FT4, and TSH by RIA because it is independent of TBG changes that result from pregnancy, birth-control pills, and estrogen replacement, is not spuriously elevated by the levothyroxine treatment itself, and is the only test that detects both subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism.  Additional serum tests are not usually necessary but have advantages under special circumstances.  Once the optimal replacement dose is determined, monitoring can be done yearly or even bi-yearly, depending on the adequacy of patient education and patient compliance.",18
"Uremic platelets have a functional defect affecting the interaction of von Willebrand factor with glycoprotein IIb-IIIa.  Uremic patients have an impaired platelet function that has been related to membrane glycoprotein (GP) abnormalities.  Using a perfusion system, we have studied the interaction of normal and uremic platelets with vessel subendothelium (SE) under flow conditions.  Reconstituted blood containing washed platelets, purified von Willebrand factor (vWF) (1 U/mL), and normal washed red blood cells was exposed to de-endothelialized rabbit segments for 10 minutes at two different shear rates (800 and 1,600 seconds-1).  In some experiments a monoclonal antibody to the GPIIb-IIIa complex (EDU3) was added to the perfusates.  With normal platelets, the percentage of the vessel covered by platelets (%CS) was 23.1% +/- 3.7% at 800 seconds-1 and 30% +/- 4.3% at 1,600 seconds-1.  Platelets were observed in contact or forming monolayers on vessel SE.  EDU3 inhibited the spreading of normal platelets.  The %CS (11.1% +/- 3.3%) was statistically decreased (P less than .01) and most of the platelets were observed in contact with the vessel surface.  These data indicate that, under flow conditions, the interaction of vWF with GPIIb-IIIa can support the spreading of normal platelets in the absence of exogenous fibrinogen.  Under the same experimental conditions, the interaction of uremic platelets with SE was markedly impaired at both shear rates studied (P less than .01 v normal platelets).  The presence of EDU3 did not modify the interaction of uremic platelets.  These results confirm the impairment of the platelet adhesion observed in uremic patients.  Furthermore, they indicate the presence of a functional defect in the interaction of vWF with GPIIb-IIIa.  The fact that perfusions with normal and uremic platelets in the presence of an antibody to the GPIIb-IIIa complex did not show any differences gives indirect evidence on a functionally normal interaction vWF/GPIb in uremic patients.",11
"Effects of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and of hydralazine on endothelial function in hypertensive rats   The function of the endothelium is impaired in hypertension.  In spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), acetylcholine-induced relaxation is decreased and serotonin-induced constriction is increased.  The goal of our study was to evaluate the effect of a long-term treatment with cilazapril, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, or hydralazine, a vasodilator, on the endothelium-dependent responses in aorta of SHR.  Wistar-Kyoto rats were used as normotensive reference.  Isolated aortic rings with or without endothelium were suspended in organ chambers.  The rings with intact endothelium were contracted with norepinephrine.  Acetylcholine-induced relaxation was markedly enhanced by cilazapril treatment.  The tension achieved at maximal relaxation was 8 +/- 4% of norepinephrine contraction in the cilazapril-treated SHR versus 55 +/- 5% in the untreated SHR (p less than 0.001).  Hydralazine had no significant effect.  The effect of serotonin was also markedly modified by cilazapril.  In untreated SHR, serotonin induced the release of a vasoconstrictor substance by the endothelium as assessed by the ratio of maximal tension induced by serotonin in rings with endothelium over maximal tension in rings without endothelium, which was greater than 1.  This ratio was reversed in cilazapril-treated SHR but not in hydralazine-treated SHR.  Captopril had effects similar to cilazapril.  Finally, evaluation of carotid arteries showed that cilazapril also prevented morphological changes of the intima in SHR (i.e., infiltration by mononuclear cells).  We conclude that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors prevent the functional and morphological alterations in endothelium that are found in hypertension and speculate that this action might participate in their antihypertensive effect.",13
"Premalignant lesions and cancers of the skin in the general population: evaluation of the role of human papillomaviruses.  To evaluate the role of human papillomaviruses (HPV) in the development of premalignant lesions and cancers of the skin in the general population, 314 biopsies obtained from 227 patients with benign neoplasms, premalignant lesions, and cancers of the skin and from 25 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lip were analyzed by Southern blot hybridization.  DNA probes specific for various cutaneous and genital HPV types were used in hybridizations conducted under nonstringent or stringent conditions.  HPV DNA sequences were only detected in eight specimens obtained from six patients: HPV 34 in one case of periungual Bowen's disease, HPV 36 and an as yet uncharacterized HPV in two cases of actinic keratosis, HPV 20 in one case of basal cell carcinoma, an as yet unrecognized HPV in one case of squamous cell carcinoma, and HPV 16 in one case of squamous cell carcinoma of the lip.  None of the specimens of cutaneous horn and keratoacanthoma contained detectable HPV DNA.  In contrast, HPV DNA sequences, mostly HPV 16, were detected in 13 of 23 cases of anogenital Bowen's disease and invasive Bowen's carcinoma.  HPV DNA sequences were not detected in 90 cutaneous samples further analyzed by the polymerase chain-reaction technique, using amplification primers that contain conserved sequences among the genomes of HPV.  These results strongly suggest that the known HPV types play only a minor role, if any, in skin carcinogenesis in the general population.",3
"Rebound increase in serum thyrotropin, anti-'microsomal' antibodies and thyroglobulin after discontinuation of L-thyroxine.  We assayed serum thyrotropin (TSH), antimicrosomal antibodies (MSA), antithyroglobulin antibodies and thyroglobulin in seven individuals with subclinical autoimmune hypothyroidism during two 6-month periods with L-thyroxine substitution and placebo, respectively.  Serum TSH decreased during L-thyroxine administration, with a rebound increase in serum TSH of about 6 months duration during placebo treatment, and a parallel increase in serum thyroglobulin.  In agreement with previous observations by other groups, we found decreased serum concentrations of MSA during L-thyroxine treatment in three individuals.  In addition, a slow but significant transient increase in serum MSA was recorded during placebo administration in the four individuals who showed the most pronounced increase in serum TSH (greater than 20 mU l-1).  This association between serum levels of MSA and TSH is most probably related to antigen presentation at the surface of the thyrocyte.  We conclude that changes in serum TSH concentration should be taken into account in the interpretation of MSA in patients with thyroid disease, whether untreated or treated with L-thyroxine.",18
"Multigenic basis for type I diabetes. Association of HRAS1 polymorphism with HLA-DR3, DQw2/DR4, DQw8.  We analyzed extended haplotypes composed of DNA loci on the short arm of chromosome 11 for segregation with insulin-dependent (type I) diabetes mellitus.  The markers for these loci are tyrosine hydroxylase, insulin, and c-Ha-ras-1 proto-oncogene (HRAS1).  We report, in a study of 27 families, that a specific haplotype (H), containing a 3-kilobase (kb) HRAS1-Taq I DNA polymorphism, segregated differentially in diabetic and nondiabetic siblings (P = 0.005).  A parallel population study showed that the 3-kb HRAS1-Taq I polymorphism is increased in frequency in type I patients having two strong HLA-susceptibility haplotypes compared with other type I patients or healthy control blood donors (P less than 0.010 and P less than 0.025, respectively).  The polymorphic variable, enhancer, and promoter regions flanking the human insulin gene on the H haplotype were not associated with type I diabetes.  These results indicate that the HRAS1 locus or genes in linkage disequilibrium with this locus are involved in the pathogenesis of HLA-DR3/4 type I diabetes mellitus.",17
"""White coat"" versus ""sustained"" borderline hypertension in Tecumseh, Michigan   During a survey of young subjects not receiving treatment for hypertension in Tecumseh, Michigan, clinic and self-monitored blood pressures taken at home (14 readings in 7 days) were obtained in 737 subjects (387 men, 350 women, average age 31.5 years).  Hypertension in the clinic was diagnosed if the clinic blood pressure exceeded 140 mm Hg systolic or 90 mm Hg diastolic.  In the absence of firm criteria for what constitutes hypertension at home, subjects whose average home blood pressure was in the upper decile of the whole population were considered to have hypertension at home.  By these criteria, 7.1% of the whole population had ""white coat"" hypertension (i.e., high clinic but not elevated home readings).  The prevalence of ""sustained"" hypertension (i.e., high readings in the clinic and at home) was 5.1%.  Subjects with white coat and sustained borderline hypertension in Tecumseh were very similar.  Both groups showed, at previous examinations (at ages 5, 8, 21, and 23 years), significantly higher blood pressure readings than the normotensive subjects.  As young adults (average age 33.3 years), the parents of both hypertensive groups had significantly higher blood pressure readings than the parents of normotensive subjects.  Both hypertensive groups had faster heart rates, higher systemic vascular resistance, and higher minimal forearm vascular resistance.  Both hypertensive groups were more overweight, had higher plasma triglycerides, insulin, and insulin/glucose ratios than normotensive subjects.  The white coat hypertensive group also had lower values of high density lipoprotein than the normotensive group.  White coat hypertension is a frequent condition.",13
"The penetration of aminoglycosides into the alveolar lining fluid of rats. The effect of airway inflammation.  The concentration-time profile of gentamicin and tobramycin in the alveolar lining fluid (ALF) of rats was determined after intravenous bolus injection using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).  BAL can be used for evaluating the penetration of both aminoglycosides into the ALF if highly sensitive detection methods are used, and an endogenous marker (urea) can be applied to avoid the unpredictable dilutional effect of the lavage procedure.  The concentration of gentamicin and tobramycin in ALF reached a peak after 5 and 10 min, respectively, and remained high when plasma concentrations were declining, suggesting an accumulation reservoir in the lung acini.  The ratio of the AUC of the concentration-time profile in ALF and plasma was 0.67 and 0.45 for gentamicin and tobramycin, respectively.  The penetration of both aminoglycosides into the ALF was significantly higher after induction of airway inflammation by inhalation of endotoxin.  The ratio of the AUC in ALF and plasma in the endotoxin-exposed animals was 0.76 and 0.55 for gentamicin and tobramycin, respectively.  The ratio of the AUC of the concentration-time profile of gentamicin in ALF to that of tobramycin was 1.27 without inflammation and 1.44 after endotoxin exposure.  Thus, both with and without inflammation, gentamicin penetrates better into the ALF than does tobramycin.",7
"Effect of fasting on the lung glutathione redox cycle in air- and oxygen-exposed mice: beneficial effects of sugar.  Fasting increases susceptibility to hyperoxic lung damage in mice, at least in part, by decreasing lung glutathione level.  To determine whether fasting alters other components of the glutathione redox cycle, and whether a diet of sugar alone reverses fasting's effects, normally fed, sugar-fed, and fasted mice were exposed to room air or 100% oxygen for up to 4 days.  In air-exposed mice, fasting decreased glutathione peroxidase (GP) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities 15% to 20% on days 3 and 4 (p less than 0.01) and glutathione level 25% to 30% on days 2 to 4 (p less than 0.05).  When corrected for protein concentration, GP and GR values were similar to those in the fed mice, but glutathione levels remained lower on days 2 and 3 (p less than 0.05).  Oxidized glutathione (GSSG) was unchanged, but the ratio of GSSG to total glutathione (reduced glutathione plus GSSG) increased on day 2 (p less than 0.05).  In oxygen-exposed fed mice, GP increased 62% and GR increased 39% on day 4 (p less than 0.05), the time when the lung injury was most severe; glutathione increased 30% on days 3 and 4 (p less than 0.05); and GSSG increased threefold and eightfold on days 3 and 4 (p less than 0.01).  Oxygen-exposed fasted mice were all dead by day 3 (versus no deaths in the fed mice), failed to increase GR and total glutathione in response to the oxidant stress, and increased GP and GSSG on day 3 to the same extent as the fed mice did on day 4.",7
"Usefulness of digital angiography in the assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction.  With modern digital cardiac systems the image data are digitized on-line and in real-time, allowing the replay and subsequent interpretation and analysis during or directly after the cardiac catheterization procedure.  In this study we have evaluated the advantages and limitations of a manual tracing technique for left ventricular digital angiograms on the Phillips DCI system.  Thirty-three patients who were catheterized for suspected coronary artery disease were studied.  The manual tracings were performed by a senior cardiologist and an experienced function-analyst.  It was found that the short- and long-term intraobserver variabilities in the assessment of the global ejection fraction were very small; short-term mean difference +/- standard deviation (correlation coefficient): 0.5 +/- 2.7 (r = 0.97) global EF%-units; long term; 0.7 +/- 2.7 (r = 0.96) EF%-units.  The interobserver variabilities (5.1 +/- 4.8 (r = 0.93) EF%-units) were slightly higher than the intraobserver variabilities.  A decrease by 25% in the amount of contrast medium administered did not significantly influence the variabilities in the contour tracings, which would suggest the use of smaller doses.  At the average, the cardiologist and the function-analyst required 6 and 11 min of analysis time for a left ventricular study, respectively, emphasizing the need for further developments towards automated contour detection.  Finally, an excellent correlation was found with a standard off-line cinefilm analysis procedure.  Thus, it may be concluded that quantitative digital left ventricular angiography based on manual tracing of the outlines performed immediately following the cardiac catheterization (post-processing) is feasible as a routine procedure for the assessment of left ventricular function.",13
"Anatomic correlations of the long-axis views in biplane transesophageal echocardiography.  The number of views obtainable during transesophageal echocardiography (TE) has been limited by the fixed position of the transducer at the end of the probe.  This has confined standard TE studies to short-axis tomography of the heart and aorta.  Recently, a biplane TE probe has become available that is capable of both long- and short-axis imaging.  This study prospectively assessed the application of the long-axis plane of the biplane probe in providing complementary long-axis views in ambulatory patients.  Six standard long-axis views could be obtained and were compared with corresponding anatomic sections to illustrate anatomic relations and facilitate structure identification.  The long-axis views provide a better appreciation of the 3-dimensional nature of cardiac anatomy and function, especially in demonstrating the relation of vertically aligned structures.",13
"Field performance of the Intoxilyzer 5000: a comparison of blood- and breath-alcohol results in Wisconsin drivers.  Intoxilyzer 5000 and blood-alcohol results from drivers arrested for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated and for related offenses were compared during a two-year period.  Three hundred and ninety-five pairs of results were studied.  The breath- and blood-alcohol specimens in this study were collected within 1 h of each other.  The mean blood-alcohol concentration obtained was 0.180 g/dL, with a range from zero to 0.338 g/dL.  By comparison, the mean Intoxilyzer 5000 result was 0.16 g/210 L with a range from zero to 0.32 g/210 L.  Compared with the blood-alcohol result, Intoxilyzer 5000 results were lower by more than 0.01 g/210 L 67% of the time, within 0.01 g/210 L 31% of the time, and higher by more than 0.01 g/210 L 2% of the time.",20
"Cutaneous melanoma and bilateral retinoblastoma.  We report the case of an otherwise healthy 37-year-old man who had had bilateral enucleation during early childhood for bilateral retinoblastomas, in addition to two cutaneous melanomas (the first appearing at age 27 years).  He also had dysplastic melanocytic nevi and a history of cutaneous melanoma in his mother.  Retinoblastoma may aggregate in families and is associated with DNA abnormalities of chromosome 13.  Recent reports have emphasized the appearance of second malignancies in retinoblastoma survivors.  The second malignancies include osteosarcoma, soft tissue sarcoma, and cutaneous melanoma.  Cutaneous melanoma also may aggregate in families, usually in the setting of dysplastic melanocytic nevi.  The features of this case and of similar reported cases suggest that there may be a greater than expected association between retinoblastoma and cutaneous melanoma.",3
"Calciotropic hormones in human and experimental hypertension.  Although altered cellular calcium handling plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of hypertension, little attention has been focused on the impact of calcium regulating hormones on this process.  Recent research provides evidence that parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, as well as newly described factors such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), exert target-organ-specific actions in cardiac and peripheral vascular tissues, are linked to the renin-aldosterone system, and thus to the control of sodium metabolism, and may directly participate in the hypertensive process, especially in low renin and salt sensitive forms of hypertensive disease.  The metabolic set-point of these linked renin and calcium hormone systems, which serve to transduce environmental dietary mineral signals at the cellular level, determines the blood pressure consequences of sodium and calcium loading and/or restriction, and helps to explain the heterogeneous and seemingly inconsistent effects of these dietary maneuvers on blood pressure.  Measurement of renin and calcium factors in hypertension thus provides a physiological basis for individualized therapeutic recommendations in human hypertension.",13
"The use of obstetric analgesia in Sweden 1983-1986   The use of obstetric analgesia was investigated in a Swedish population-based prospective study of 335,207 births, which represents almost all women who had vaginal deliveries in Sweden between 1983 and 1986.  Lumbar epidural analgesia (EDA) was used in 16%, paracervical block (PCB) in 12%, pethidine or morphine in 49% and pudendal block in 62%.  All four types of analgesia were much more commonly used by nulliparae than multiparae.  Variables such as maternal age, smoking, nationality, relationship with the infant's father and gestational age had only moderate influence on the rates of different types of analgesia.  EDA and PCB were more frequently used in larger than in smaller hospitals and in the daytime than at night.  No such differences were found for pethidine or morphine, or pudendal block, which were administered routinely by midwives.",9
"The buddy volunteer commitment in AIDS care.  Buddy volunteers provide crucial assistance to people with HIV-related illnesses.  Based on volunteers' self-administered questionnaires, our study describes the nature of buddy work.  Volunteers indicated their satisfaction with both personal performance and buddy program administration.  Several factors were associated with volunteer satisfaction.  This report is a first attempt to describe this special relationship created in response to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic.",19
"Effect of intravenous streptokinase on the relation between initial ST-predicted size and final QRS-estimated size of acute myocardial infarcts.  Thrombolytic therapy has been documented to reduce acute myocardial infarct size.  The previously established relation between initial ST segment elevation and final electrocardiographic (ECG) myocardial infarct size in patients without coronary reperfusion might therefore be altered by thrombolytic therapy.  The effect of intravenous streptokinase on this relation was therefore studied in 73 patients with initial acute myocardial infarction who had participated in the Second International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS-2).  Patients who received streptokinase were considered as one group and patients who did not receive streptokinase as a control group.  Final myocardial infarct size, which was estimated from the QRS score, was predicted from the admission standard ECG by previously developed formulas based on ST segment elevation.  In the 40 control patients there was no change from ST-predicted to final QRS-estimated infarct size (median 17.7% versus 18.3%; p = NS).  In the 33 patients in the streptokinase group, there was a highly significant decrease from predicted to final myocardial infarct size (median 21.9% versus 16.2%; p less than 0.0002).  This decrease was found for both anterior (median 23.7% versus 19.5%; p less than 0.03) and inferior (median 21.9% versus 12.0%; p = 0.001) infarct locations.  Multiple regression analysis adjusting for differences in predicted infarct size confirmed the significance of streptokinase on the difference in infarct size (p = 0.006).  Based on the variability of the percent change from predicted to final infarct size in the control group, a threshold decrease greater than or equal to 20% is required for identification of salvage.",13
"Percutaneous balloon dilatation of benign biliary strictures.  Percutaneous biliary dilatation is an effective alternative to surgical management of benign biliary strictures that has low morbidity and no reported mortality.  Reported success rates for this procedure range from 40% to 90% depending on the size of the series, the type of patient being treated, and the length of follow-up period.  The procedure is done in the fluoroscopy suite with an angioplasty balloon catheter.  Transhepatic access is most common, but the procedure may be done via existing T-tube tracts or specially created jejunal loops.  As the frequency of radical liver surgery such as liver transplant and radical trisegmentectomy rises, so too, the rate of biliary stricture is likely to rise, making percutaneous balloon dilatation an increasingly important tool in the interventional radiologist's armamentarium.",22
"Cerebral hemodynamics in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus: correlation between cerebral circulation time and dementia.  Regional cerebral blood flow and regional cerebral circulation time were measured in 13 demented patients with chronic hydrocephalus, mostly normal pressure hydrocephalus.  The average hemispheric, frontal, and temporal cerebral blood flows were significantly reduced.  The average regional cerebral circulation time values were significantly prolonged in the frontal, temporal, and thalamic regions, most markedly in the frontal white matter, where periventricular lucency was observed on computed tomography.  Clinical improvement was obtained in all patients after operation.  While postoperative regional cerebral blood flow values did not change compared with preoperative ones, postoperative regional cerebral circulation time values were significantly reduced in all the regions measured, and most markedly in the frontal white matter.  The present results suggest that microcirculation in the frontal lobe is closely correlated with dementia in association with pressure exerted on the nerve fibers in the frontal white matter in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus.",9
"Real and pseudo late asthmatic reactions after submaximal exercise challenge in patients with bronchial asthma. A new definition for late asthmatic responses after exercise challenge.  The late asthmatic reaction after exercise challenge remains a controversial issue.  In this study, 21 patients recorded peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) on two control days without performing exercise.  There was no difference between both control days when PEFR at 1 h was compared with baseline PEFR and when PEFR at 4 to 13 hours was compared with baseline PEFR.  After analyzing variation coefficients of baseline PEFR on a control day and exercise day, PEFR was not allowed to differ more than 15.3 percent in the same patient when comparing exercise day and control day for the late fall in PEFR in the study.  In 17 of 81 patients, a late asthmatic reaction after exercise challenge was present when PEFR fall was greater than or equal to 20 percent compared with baseline PEFR value.  In eight of the 17 patients, a real late asthmatic reaction to exercise challenge was present with a PEFR fall greater than or equal to 20 percent on at least three successive time points and who had a PEFR fall greater than or equal to 20 percent compared with corresponding clocktime on a control day.  The late asthmatic reaction to exercise challenge is characterized not as a nonspecific epiphenomenon, but as a fall in PEFR of greater than or equal to 20 percent compared with baseline PEFR value and with corresponding clocktime on a control day on at least three successive time points.  Graphic illustration of airway responses following exercises may facilitate the detection of a late asthmatic response.",7
"Human macrophage colony-stimulating factor induces macrophage colonies after L-phenylalanine methylester treatment of human marrow.  Macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) has well-known effects on murine bone marrow, but its colony stimulating activity for human bone marrow is controversial.  After treatment of human bone marrow with L-phenylalanine methylester (PME), macrophage-colonies (CFU-M) were induced by M-CSF in a dose-dependent fashion.  The optimal concentration of recombinant human-macrophage colony stimulating factor (rhM-CSF) was 1,000 U/mL.  Purified human urine M-CSF had colony stimulating activity similar to rhM-CSF.  Further studies were performed to determine the factors responsible for the enhanced CFU-M formation from PME treated marrow.  Compared with nylon wool and carbonyl iron monocyte depletion methods, PME eliminated significantly more monocytes and myeloid cells.  This observation suggested that these cells may release hematopoietic inhibitory factors for CFU-M.  Low concentrations (1%) but not normal (10%) concentrations of blood monocytes were inhibitory (mean inhibition, 48%) to CFU-M.  High concentrations of monocytes (50%) augmented CFU-M colonies.  HL-60 conditioned media was used to simulate secretory products of early myeloid cells.  HL-60 conditioned media (1%) inhibited CFU-M formation but not granulocyte macrophage or granulocyte colonies.  We conclude that M-CSF has colony stimulating activity for human marrow that can be recognized after removal of inhibitory cells by PME treatment.",3
"Family of glucose-transporter genes. Implications for glucose homeostasis and diabetes.  Glucose transport by facilitated diffusion is mediated by a family of tissue-specific membrane glycoproteins.  At least four members of this gene family have been identified by cDNA cloning.  The HepG2-type transporter is the most widely distributed of these proteins.  It provides many cells with their basal glucose requirement for ATP production and the biosynthesis of sugar-containing macromolecules.  The liver-type transporter is expressed in tissues from which a net release of glucose can occur and in beta-cells of pancreatic islets.  A genetic defect resulting in reduced activity of this transporter could hypothetically lead to the two principal features of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance and relative hypoinsulinemia.  The adipocyte/muscle transporter is expressed exclusively in tissues that are insulin sensitive with respect to glucose uptake.  This protein is an excellent candidate for a highly specific genetic defect predisposing to insulin resistance.",17
"Long-term fate of the vascularized iliac crest bone graft for mandibular reconstruction.  Vascularized bone grafts, such as the iliac crest, have become a major tool for mandibular reconstruction.  Due to the growing trend toward immediate bone replacement followed by implant osseointegration and dental rehabilitation, further understanding of the long-term characteristics of these grafts is essential.  Early postoperative bone scans demonstrate increased activity within the vascularized graft relative to surrounding bone.  This study addressed the use of bone SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) scintigraphy as a long-term method of evaluating the integrity of vascularized bone grafts.",6
"Low level atmospheric sulfur dioxide pollution and childhood asthma.  Quarterly analysis (1983-1987) of childhood asthma in Hong Kong from 13,620 hospitalization episodes in relation to levels of pollutants (SO2, NO2, NO, O3, TSP, and RSP) revealed a seasonal pattern of attack rates that correlates inversely with exposure to sulfur dioxide (r = -.52, P less than .05).  The same cannot be found with other pollutants.  Many factors may contribute to the seasonal variation of asthma attacks.  We speculate that prolonged exposure (in terms of months) to low level SO2 is one factor that might induce airway inflammation and bronchial hyperreactivity and predispose to episodes of asthma.",19
"Upper gastrointestinal pathology in familial adenomatous polyposis: results from a prospective study of 102 patients.  Multiple gastric and duodenal biopsy specimens from 102 asymptomatic patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, taken during a prospective endoscopic screening programme were examined.  One hundred patients had microscopic gastroduodenal pathology, often in the absence of macroscopic lesions.  Adenomas were found in 94 patients in the duodenum, in the second and third parts.  Hyperplasia of villous and crypt epithelium was also seen, sometimes in the absence of adenomas: this may be a precursor of neoplastic change.  In the stomach fundic gland polyps were the commonest abnormality, seen microscopically in 44 patients.  Chronic antral gastritis was common in patients without fundic polyps.  Gastric adenomas were present in six patients, all of whom also had duodenal adenomas.  If duodenal adenomas in familial adenomatous polyposis have a similar malignant potential to those in the colorectum sequential endoscopy and biopsy are necessary to detect cancer in these patients.",3
"Morphometric analysis of follicular center cell lymphomas.  The Lukes/Collins classification of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas subdivides follicular center cell (FCC) lymphomas into four categories based on nuclear size, shape, and state of transformation.  Because of the well-recognized difficulty in making these subdivisions in routine histologic sections, a morphometric analysis of typical small cleaved (SC), large cleaved (LC), small noncleaved (SNC), and large noncleaved (LNC) FCCs was performed to describe and compare these four categories using objective parameters.  The following features, which had been previously tested on normal follicles, were measured and calculated: nuclear area (NA), nuclear contour index of ellipticity (NCIe), nuclear contour index of nuclear irregularity (NCIni), and a relative chromatin dispersal index (CDI).  The presence of nucleoli also was recorded.  Mean values for the NA, NCIe, NCIni, and CDI were significantly different among all four FCC lymphoma subtypes, except that the CDI, which reflects transformation, was similar for the SC and LC cell groups.  Comparison using the proportion of cells with nucleoli in each case revealed significant differences between all but the SNC and LNC groups.  The LC group had the highest mean nuclear ellipticity and nuclear irregularity values.  Mean nuclear area was smallest for the SC group followed by the LC, SNC, and LNC groups.  Despite these many differences, all parameters showed a broad spectrum of values when either mean values for individual cases of each FCC subtype or distribution curves for all cells within a certain subtype were compared.  This morphometric data demonstrates that the four histologically recognized types of FCC lymphomas are distinctive using a more analytic technique.  This study also provides further insight into the differences among them.  Evidence of nuclear transformation (nuclear size, chromatin dispersal, and frequent nucleoli) is a more important criterion than nuclear contours in distinguishing LNC from LC lymphomas.  Although LC lymphomas have some features intermediate between SC and the noncleaved FCC lymphomas, they more closely resemble SC lymphomas.  Finally morphometric analyses such as these provide an objective morphologic foundation for future prospective investigations of transformation-related phenomena; these studies may facilitate comparison of morphologic data with immunophenotype and genotype in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and comparison of various other B-cell neoplasms with follicular center cell neoplasms.",19
"Antibiotic use among children in an urban Brazilian slum: a risk factor for diarrhea? [published erratum appears in Am J Public Health 1991 Apr;81(4):417]  Among a cohort of children in a poor urban setting in Brazil, the relative risk for the occurrence of a new episode of diarrhea in the two weeks following antibiotic use vs all other weeks was 1.44 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.33, 2.45).  Among children ever [corrected] exposed to antibiotics, the odds ratio was 1.34 (95% CI = 0.84, 2.16) after stratifying by individual child and controlling for previous diarrhea.  Further research is needed to confirm whether antibiotics are a risk factor for diarrhea in such settings.",5
Urgent care center pediatric telephone advice.  Pediatric telephone advice is sought frequently by members of the community.  This study was undertaken to evaluate the quality and accuracy of pediatric telephone advice given by free-standing urgent care centers.  One hundred such facilities were telephoned and advice was requested by a research assistant.  A case was presented that could have represented a pediatric medical emergency.  Overall only 17 centers gave adequate advice.  The data suggest that under some circumstances free-standing urgent care center pediatric telephone advice may be inaccurate and inappropriate.  Workable policies and protocols for pediatric telephone advice should be instituted by these facilities.,22
"X linked hypophosphataemia: treatment, height gain, and nephrocalcinosis.  The clinical data of 18 patients with X linked hypophosphataemia were analysed retrospectively.  The height data were expressed as SD scores.  There was no difference in the final height of patients treated with vitamin D (or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) and phosphate for at least two years (n = 12) and that of 16 hypophosphataemic family members who had never been treated.  The mean final SD score (-2.07) of treated patients, however, was significantly higher than the value before treatment (-2.79), which indicated an average absolute height gain of 4-4.5 cm compared with the expected height values.  Six of the treated patients developed ultrasonographically detectable nephrocalcinosis with normal renal function.  The daily phosphate intake and excretion of patients with nephrocalcinosis was significantly higher than that of patients with normal renal morphology.  There was no difference in the doses of vitamin D between the two groups.  The average urinary calcium:creatinine ratio of the two groups was similar to and below the hypercalciuric 0.6 mmol:mmol limit.  The group with nephrocalcinosis, however, had a higher incidence of hypercalciuric episodes than the group without nephrocalcinosis (12 in 130 observations compared with six in 334 observations, respectively).  The benefits and risks of treatment of patients with X linked hypophosphataemia must be further evaluated.  The high dose of phosphate seems to be an important factor in the development of nephrocalcinosis in this group of patients.",11
"HBV-DNA sequences in tumor and nontumor tissue in a patient with the fibrolamellar variant of hepatocellular carcinoma.  One patient with the fibrolamellar variant of hepatocellular carcinoma was found to be seropositive for HBsAg and anti-HBe.  DNA from tumor and nontumor areas of the liver was examined by molecular hybridization for hepatitis B virus DNA sequences.  Undigested DNA from the tumor gave a high-molecular-weight smear, and restriction-enzyme analysis indicated a single instance of integration.  Nontumor liver tissue was analyzed from three separate areas.  Hepatitis B virus DNA was detected in two of these; restriction-enzyme digestion suggested they contained different sites of viral integration.  As with the typical hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma, analysis of hepatitis B virus DNA from nontumorous liver yielded a different pattern of high-molecular-weight bands, indicating that the virus genome had integrated at different chromosomal locations than that seen in the tumor.  The finding of integrated hepatitis B virus DNA, especially in tumorous but also in nontumorous liver, would be consistent with an oncogenic role for hepatitis B virus in certain instances of fibrolamellar tumors and in the more typical hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma.",3
"Human immunodeficiency virus and the primary care physician.  As the scope and size of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic grows, the primary care physician will need to assume a greater role.  A knowledge of HIV risk factors and the ability to perform pretest and posttest counseling for HIV testing is essential.  Counseling patients on HIV risk reduction should be part of the HIV risk interview.  An understanding of the benefits and contraindications of testing, as well as a respect for the impact of testing, is important.  All HIV-seropositive individuals should undergo a complete history and review of symptoms as soon as test results are known.  Judicious use of laboratory testing, including monitoring of CD4 cell counts, is recommended.  Pneumocystis carinii prophylaxis and zidovudine therapy should be offered to patients with appropriately low CD4 counts.",1
"Pharmacology of pravadoline: a new analgesic agent.  Pravadoline is a new chemical entity with analgesic activity in humans.  This report describes the pharmacology of pravadoline and compares the activity of pravadoline with that of two major classes of analgesics, the opioids and the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  Like the NSAIDs, pravadoline inhibited the synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs) in mouse brain both in vitro (IC50, 4.9 microM) and ex vivo (ED50, 20 mg/kg p.o.) and displayed antinociceptive activity in rodents subjected to a variety of chemical, thermal and mechanical nociceptive stimuli.  Administration of pravadoline prevented the writhing response induced by i.p.  administration of acetylcholine (ED50, 41 mg/kg p.o.) or PGE2 (ED50, 24 mg/kg p.o.) and prolonged the response latency induced by tail immersion in hot water at a temperature of 55 degrees C (minimum effective dose, 100 mg/kg s.c.).  In the rat, treatment with pravadoline prevented acetic acid-induced writhing (ED50, 15 mg/kg p.o.), brewer's yeast-induced hyperalgesia (Randall-Selitto test) (minimum effective dose, 1 mg/kg p.o.), the nociceptive response induced by paw flexion in the adjuvant-arthritic rat (ED50, 41 mg/kg p.o.) and bradykinin-induced head and forepaw flexion (ED50, 78 mg/kg, p.o.).  The antinociceptive activity of pravadoline cannot be explained by an opioid mechanism, because pravadoline-induced antinociception was not antagonized by naloxone (1 mg/kg s.c.) and pravadoline did not bind to opioid receptors at concentrations up to 10 microM.  However, like the opioid analgesics, pravadoline diminished the electrically induced twitch response of mouse vas deferens preparations, but, in contrast to opioids, this action of pravadoline was not attenuated by naloxone.  The possibility is discussed that this effect of pravadoline upon isolated tissues may contribute to its antinociceptive activity.  In contrast to NSAIDs, pravadoline was more potent ex vivo as an inhibitor of the formation of PGs in brain vs.  stomach.  In addition, pravadoline failed to produce gastrointestinal lesions when administered p.o.  to rats or mice, and did not possess significant anti-inflammatory activity at antinociceptive doses.  Also unlike NSAIDs, pravadoline inhibited rat gastrointestinal transit when administered at doses similar to those which were antinociceptive.  The overall pharmacologic profile of pravadoline suggests that the compound may be capable of managing more diverse or more severe pain than is achieved by anti-inflammatory analgesics, without producing side effects commonly associated with either the opioid or the nonopioid analgesics.",5
"Maintaining periodontal treatment.  Dental maintenance, or supportive periodontal treatment (SPT), can keep the periodontium and peri-implant tissues healthy after active therapy.  Patients who comply to suggested SPT fare better periodontally and keep their teeth longer.  Data should be gathered by examinations, talking with patients, and reviewing personal oral hygiene.  Then sub- and supra-gingival deposits should be removed.  The average SPT visit should last 1 hour and should be scheduled every 3 months.  Supportive periodontal treatment for patients with more advanced periodontal or peri-implant destruction should be the responsibility of the periodontist.",6
"Increased overnight growth hormone concentrations in diabetic compared with normal adolescents.  To determine the extent to which spontaneous plasma GH concentrations are abnormal in adolescents with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus we performed 12-h overnight plasma GH profiles in 21 diabetic adolescents (11 males and 10 females; aged 9.8-16.5 yr; median, 13.6 yr) and 34 healthy adolescent controls (17 males and 17 females; aged 9.1-20.9 yr; median, 13.1 yr).  Data were analyzed using the pulse detection program Pulsar and time series analysis, and are presented with respect to age and puberty stage.  Mean and maximum GH concentrations, sum of the peak amplitudes, and mean calculated baseline concentrations in the normal children were higher during puberty; highest levels were seen in girls at puberty stages 2-3, and in boys at stages 4-5.  A similar pattern was observed in the diabetic adolescents, but all measures of pulse height and mean calculated baseline concentrations were significantly greater than those in the normal subjects (multivariate analysis, P less than 0.001).  Pulse frequency did not change during puberty in the normal or diabetic subjects, and the dominant pulse periodicity in both groups was about 180 min.  We conclude that the predominant change in GH release during puberty is in pulse amplitude, and that this is increased in diabetes, whereas pulse frequency remains constant in both normal and diabetic adolescents.",17
"Various methods for calculation of Kt/V: a clinical comparison.  Analysis of the National Cooperative Dialysis Study (NCDS) showed that dialysis morbidity and mortality was related to Kt/V of urea.  Various formulas have been derived to make calculation of Kt/V simpler.  We compared the kinetically measured Kt/V (A) to estimated Kt/V derived from approximate total body water (0.6 body weight) and uniform dialyzer clearance (B), Kt/V = 0.04 PRU-1.2 where PRU is % reduction in BUN (C) and Kt/V = In(R-0.03-UF/W) where R is post/pre BUN, UF is ultrafiltration L/HD and W is postdialysis weight (D) in 26 patients.  The correlation coefficient (r) was 0.14 (p less than 0.05) for A vs.  B; 0.75 (p less than 0.01) A vs.  C; 0.77 (p less than 0.01) A vs.  D; and 0.97 for C vs.  D.  In an additional 51 patients, Kt/V was calculated using formulas B, C, and D.  The r was 0.91 C vs.  D, 0.70 B vs.  D, and 0.68 B vs.  C.  With B, greater than 30% of the patients could have been misclassified using NCDS criteria for adequacy of dialysis.  The study suggests that use of formulas C and D, but not B, is appropriate and accurate for Kt/V calculation.  Formula C may be simpler and easier than D, as UF and W are not required.  Serial Kt/V could be easily and accurately calculated using C and D for quality assurance and quantitation of dialysis.",11
"Lack of predictive value of islet cell antibodies, insulin antibodies, and HLA-DR phenotype for remission in cyclosporin-treated IDDM patients. The Canadian-European Randomized Control Trial Group.  The effect of immunosuppression on the humoral immune response to islet autoantigens and exogenously administered insulin and the predictive value of islet cell cytoplasmic antibodies (ICAs), insulin antibodies (IAs), and HLA-DR phenotype for remission during immunosuppression were studied in a prospective randomized double-blind trial of cyclosporin administration in 98 newly diagnosed insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients.  HLA-DR phenotype and glycosylated hemoglobin were determined at study entry, and insulin requirement, glucagon-stimulated C-peptide, ICAs, and IAs were measured at entry and after 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 mo of follow-up.  Cyclosporin therapy caused significant suppression of the prevalence and serum concentrations of ICAs and IAs.  Cyclosporin-treated IDDM patients ICA+ at study entry had higher levels of stimulated C-peptide after 1 mo of study, but the increased beta-cell function was not associated with a higher frequency of insulin-free remission at 1 mo.  ICA and IA status at entry did not predict cyclosporin-insulin-free remission as assessed by the prevalence of insulin-free remission or beta-cell function at 3-12 mo of study, and significant decrements in the titers or total disappearance of ICAs were not associated with an increased prevalence or duration of non-insulin-requiring remission or higher stimulated C-peptide values.  There was no correlation between the serum levels of ICAs and IAs at entry and beta-cell function at 12 mo of follow-up.",17
"Efficacy of methylphenidate among mentally retarded children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  Twelve children with IQ scores of 50 to 74 (educable mental retardation) who met rigorous diagnostic criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder participated in a double-blind crossover study of the efficacy of two doses of methylphenidate compared with placebo.  Dependent measures included behavioral ratings, classroom work output, laboratory measures of attention and learning, and direct observations of social behavior.  Improvement with medication on the Conners Hyperactivity Index was observed in 75% of subjects.  Significant increases in work output, on-task behavior, and attentional skills were associated with methylphenidate.  However, gains in measures of attention were not associated with improvement in learning, as measured by a paired associate learning task.  Additionally, no significant increases in appropriate social interactions during free play were associated with methylphenidate.  The results suggest that mentally retarded children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder respond to methylphenidate at similar rates and in similar domains to that of the nonretarded population.",9
"Percutaneous central venous catheterization. Three years' experience in a neonatal intensive care unit.  Prolonged venous access is desirable in very-low-birth-weight infants and infants for whom feedings are contraindicated.  We prospectively evaluated 481 small-diameter venous catheters placed percutaneously in 317 patients over 3 years.  Of 478 catheters, 241 (50%) were placed in infants weighing 1 kg or less.  Mean catheter stay was 13 days (range, less than 1 to 77 days).  Almost half (49%) of the central and thoracic catheters (91% of placements) were removed nonelectively: 43% due to problems such as leaking or clotting and 6% to suspicion of sepsis or venous occlusion.  Of the 23 episodes of possible sepsis in the 478 catheter stays, six (1.3%) were confirmed catheter-related sepsis; 12 (2.5%) were confirmed alternate locus sepsis.  Three factors specific to percutaneous central venous catheter-related sepsis were prolonged catheter stay (3 to 5 weeks), Staphylococcus epidermidis, and weight less than or equal to 1 kg.  Four factors specific to alternate locus sepsis were presence of an alternate infection site, earlier infection (1 to 2 weeks), extremely low birth weight, and prolonged clinical instability.  Percutaneous central venous catheterizations reduced the need for the stress of repeated venipuncture, resulting in lower complication rates than those reported with surgically placed central venous catheters, and leading to identification of risk factors specific to catheter sepsis and alternate locus sepsis.",0
"Regional and systemic distribution of anti-tumor x anti-CD3 heteroaggregate antibodies and cultured human peripheral blood lymphocytes in a human colon cancer xenograft.  Anti-tumor antibody (317G5) covalently coupled to an anti-CD3 antibody (OKT3) produces a heteroaggregate (HA) antibody that can target PBL to lyse tumor cells expressing the appropriate tumor Ag.  The i.v.  and i.p.  distribution of radiolabeled HA antibody 317G5 x OKT3 and of radiolabeled cultured human PBL were studied in athymic nude mice bearing solid intraperitoneal tumor established from the human colon tumor line, LS174T.  Mice were injected with 125I-labeled HA antibody, 125I-labeled anti-tumor mAb, or 111In-labeled PBL, and at designated timepoints tissues were harvested and measured for radioactivity.  125I-317G5 x OKT3 localized specifically to tumor sites.  Tumor radioactivity levels (percent injected dose/gram) were lower with 125I-317G5 x OKT3 HA antibody than with 125I-317G5 anti-tumor mAb, but were similar to levels reported for other anti-tumor mAb.  The major difference in radioactivity levels observed between i.v.  and i.p.  administration of 125I-317G5 x OKT3 was an increase in hepatic radioactivity after i.v.  HA antibody administration.  HA antibodies produced from F(ab')2 fragments, which exhibit decreased m.  w.  and decreased Fc receptor-mediated binding, demonstrated improved tumor:tissue ratios as compared to intact antibody HA.  125I-317G5 F(ab')2 x OKT3 F(ab')2 antibody levels were equivalent to intact HA antibody levels in tumor, but were lower than intact HA antibody levels in the blood, bowel, and liver.  Tumor:bowel ratios (20:1 at 48 h) were highest when 317G5 F(ab')2 x OKT3 F(ab')2 was injected i.p.  Autoradiography confirmed that anti-tumor x anti-CD3 HA antibodies localized specifically to intraperitoneal tumor; that i.p.  administered HA antibodies penetrated tumor directly; and that i.v.  administered HA antibodies distributed along tumor vasculature.  Cultured human PBL distributed in moderate concentrations to intraperitoneal tumor when administered i.p., but not when administered i.v.  The poor localization of i.v.  injected PBL to tumor may reflect species disparity in homing receptors and/or endothelial ligands, a problem which may be overcome with a syngeneic model.  These results suggest that regional therapy with HA antibodies and PBL may offer advantages over systemic therapy for initial clinical trials.",3
"The changing epidemiology of diabetes mellitus among Navajo Indians.  Although early descriptions of diabetes mellitus among Navajo Indians characterized the disease as an infrequent and ""benign chemical abnormality,"" the prevalence of diabetes and its complications among Navajos appears to have increased substantially in this century.  We reviewed recent Indian Health Service inpatient and ambulatory care data and compared these data with previous reports.  Of the estimated Navajo population aged 45 years or older, 4,331 (16.9%) had an ambulatory care visit for diabetes between October 1, 1986, and September 30, 1987.  Diabetes was coded for 1,041 (7.0%) of hospital admissions of persons aged 20 and older.  Of 377 lower-extremity amputations done from 1978 to 1987, diabetes was involved in 245 (66%).  The 1986 age-adjusted mortality rate from diabetes was 30.3 per 100,000, approximately twice that for the general US population.  The explanation for the increased prevalence of diabetes mellitus among Navajos probably relates to an increasing prevalence of obesity.",17
"The protective effect of the oral contraceptive pill on rheumatoid arthritis: an overview of the analytic epidemiological studies using meta-analysis.  The oral contraceptive pill (OCP) has been implicated as having a protective effect on the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  The results of 12 studies have now been reported and produced differing results and conclusions.  Because of the discrepancy in results and the importance of the issue we undertook a review of the studies and performed a meta-analysis.  In all, 9 independent studies satisfied the criteria for selection, 6 case-control design and 3 longitudinal.  Using standard meta-analysis techniques, the overall pooled odds ratio for all the studies was 0.68 for the crude results (95% CI 0.58-0.78) and 0.73 for the adjusted results (95% CI 0.61-0.85).  The graphical odd-man-out method produced a 94% interval of 0.70-0.72.  The pooled odds ratio of the case-control studies was lower than for the longitudinal studies.  However, subdividing studies by the type of case source produced a pooled odds ratio for studies using hospital-based cases of 0.49 (95% CI 0.39-0.63) which was considerably less than that of studies using population-based cases: 0.95 (0.78-1.16).  This difference was unlikely to have explained by bias due to selection of controls.  We suggest that OCP use may not have a ""protective effect"" on the development of RA but may prevent the progression to severe disease by modifying the disease process.",16
"Isometric features of orthostatic tremor: an electromyographic analysis.  A patient is described with ""orthostatic"" tremor.  Electromyography revealed tremor bursts of 15 Hz in the lower extremities while standing and with isometric activation of the muscles, but the bursts disappeared with isotonic activation of muscles.  Similar tremor was recorded in the arms with isometric, but not isotonic activation.  Review of previously reported cases confirms these findings.  The clinical and electrophysiologic features of this tremor distinguish it from other recognized forms of tremor.",22
"An analysis of outcome following percutaneous transluminal coronary artery angioplasty. An autopsy series.  We analyzed autopsy findings on 26 patients who died following percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA).  Twenty-one patients died within 3 weeks of undergoing PTCA; demonstrable cardiac complications were found in 19 patients: platelet-fibrin thrombi (10 patients [48%]), coronary artery dissections (17 patients [81%]), thromboemboli (13 patients [62%]), atheroemboli (seven patients [33%]), and myocardial infarcts (17 patients [81%]).  An increased incidence of coronary platelet-fibrin thrombi was noted when compared with a non-PTCA cardiac autopsy population (five of 53 patients).  Apparently there was an increased incidence of coronary atheroemboli and thromboemboli in the patients with coronary platelet-fibrin thrombi (eight patients) when compared with patients who did not have platelet-fibrin thrombi (five patients), although this was not statistically significant.  There was no evidence of a systemic hypercoagulable state or of disseminated intravascular coagulation.  The pathogenesis of this is unclear; however, vasospasm and a disruption of the endothelial surface induced by PTCA with subsequent platelet activation are possible causes.  Although not statistically significant, there was a proponderance of female subjects (seven patients) and an increased incidence of diabetes mellitus (six patients) and hypertension (13 patients) when compared with a control population of all patients undergoing PTCA at The Cleveland (Ohio) Clinic Foundation in 1987, suggesting that diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and female sex may be clinical risk factors for fatal complications following PTCA.",13
"Secondary correction of the unilateral cleft lip nose using a conchal composite graft.  The secondary deformity of the unilateral cleft lip nose has many components.  One is the dorsal dislocation of the lateral crus of the alar cartilage.  We used a conchal composite graft positioned between the piriform aperture and the lateral crus and the upper lateral cartilage to correct this dislocation in nine patients.  We believe that this graft is effective because it elevates the lateral crus of the alar cartilage off the depressed piriform aperture.  This technique is very simple to perform, and it is easy to achieve nasal symmetry.  Our results have been quite satisfactory, with no recurrence of dorsal dislocation.  The donor site was covered by a subcutaneous pedicled flap from the cephaloauricular sulcus, leaving an inconspicuous deformity.",6
"Nonuniform regional deformation of the pericardium during the cardiac cycle in dogs.  We hypothesized that local contact forces between the pericardium and the heart cause regional variation in pericardial deformation during the cardiac cycle, reflecting volume changes of the underlying cardiac chambers.  To test this, we measured regional pericardial area over the right atrium (RA) and right ventricle (RV) with orthogonal pairs of sonomicrometers in six open-chest dogs.  At a left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 5 mm Hg, RV pericardial area paralleled RV volume, that is, shrinkage during ejection by 10 +/- 8% and expansion during filling.  RA pericardial area was reciprocally related to RV pericardial area, with average expansion during ventricular ejection of 2 +/- 2%, thus paralleling RA volume during RV ejection.  With volume loading, RV pericardial shrinkage during ejection increased to 14 +/- 6%, but the RA pericardial area change was no longer reciprocal (0 +/- 3% change during RV ejection).  Elimination of contact forces by cardiac tamponade resulted in both marked attenuation of RV pericardial area changes and synchronization of the RV and RA pericardial area pattern; that is, both shrank during RV ejection.  In two additional dogs, measurement of pericardial area over left ventricle and atrium showed similar results.  We conclude that dynamic pericardial contact forces cause regional variation in pericardial deformation, which reflects volume changes of the underlying chambers.  These findings imply that the influence of the pericardium on filling and ejection may be more complex than previously recognized, varying both by chamber and dynamically over the course of the cardiac cycle.",13
"Digital rectal examination in the early detection of prostate cancer.  Screening using digital rectal examination improves the clinical stage distribution of prostate cancer and prolongs survival.  Unfortunately, digital rectal examination may not be sensitive enough to detect the small-volume tumors that are most amenable to cure.  In several studies, approximately 50 per cent of cancers detected through screening had already spread beyond the prostate.  Regardless, the key to demonstrating overall benefit from screening is a diminished disease-specific mortality rate.  To date, this has not been shown.  Lower mortality rates from prostate cancer can be demonstrated only through a randomized study comparing screened and unscreened populations.  Such a study, which has recently been approved and funded by the National Institutes of Health, will require 10 to 15 years to complete.  Until that time, the value of screening for prostate cancer by digital rectal examination or any other method will be unknown.  Beyond a lack of proved benefit, screening for prostate cancer may be harmful because of the variable natural history of the disease and the morbidity and mortality rates associated with treatment.  There exists a large population of patients with pathologically detectable prostate cancer who will never have clinical disease.  The detection of some of these tumors may expose those patients to the risks of unnecessary treatment.  Large-scale prostate cancer screening studies may ultimately be shown to be advantageous.  The sooner this occurs, the earlier aggressive screening can be advocated, similar to screening for breast cancer.  However, the temptation to embark on such screening programs without first demonstrating clear benefit should be resisted.",11
"Low-dose lovastatin safely lowers cholesterol after cardiac transplantation.  Hypercholesterolemia occurs in many cardiac transplant patients and may aggravate graft coronary arteriopathy as well as contributing to peripheral vascular disease.  Lovastatin, which inhibits 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, in doses of 40-80 mg/day effectively lowers cholesterol in the general cardiac population but has been associated with rhabdomyolysis in cardiac transplant recipients.  To determine whether lower doses of lovastatin would be effective and safe for lowering cholesterol after cardiac transplantation, 44 patients with blood cholesterol greater than 200 mg/dl at least 6 months after cardiac transplantation received 10-20 mg lovastatin daily.  In addition, lovastatin enzyme inhibitor level was assayed in six patients to determine whether metabolism of the drug was abnormal.  Lovastatin decreased total cholesterol by 28% from 282 +/- 54 to 208 +/- 62 mg/dl (p less than 0.005), primarily because of reduction in the low-density lipoprotein fractions, and was well-tolerated without any symptoms or abnormal creatine phosphokinase levels in 43 of 44 patients.  One patient developed rhabdomyolysis and reversible renal failure when lovastatin was increased to 40 mg daily.  Enzyme inhibitor levels in the six transplant patients were 4.2-7.8 times higher than those measured in normal volunteers.  Low-dose lovastatin effectively lowers cholesterol in patients after transplantation, but metabolism is altered, perhaps by cyclosporine.  Monitoring of enzyme inhibitor levels may be required to allow safe administration of this drug to cardiac transplant recipients.",17
"Germ line p53 mutations in a familial syndrome of breast cancer, sarcomas, and other neoplasms   Familial cancer syndromes have helped to define the role of tumor suppressor genes in the development of cancer.  The dominantly inherited Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is of particular interest because of the diversity of childhood and adult tumors that occur in affected individuals.  The rarity and high mortality of LFS precluded formal linkage analysis.  The alternative approach was to select the most plausible candidate gene.  The tumor suppressor gene, p53, was studied because of previous indications that this gene is inactivated in the sporadic (nonfamilial) forms of most cancers that are associated with LFS.  Germ line p53 mutations have been detected in all five LFS families analyzed.  These mutations do not produce amounts of mutant p53 protein expected to exert a trans-dominant loss of function effect on wild-type p53 protein.  The frequency of germ line p53 mutations can now be examined in additional families with LFS, and in other cancer patients and families with clinical features that might be attributed to the mutation.",3
"Use of the levator scapulae muscle flap in head and neck reconstruction.  There are numerous techniques available for reconstruction of defects following composite resection of oral cavity and oropharyngeal tumors.  No single technique is applicable in all situations.  The levator scapulae muscle flap is well known for its application in carotid protection.  Little attention is paid to its usefulness in other aspects of head and neck reconstruction.  We have been using the levator scapulae muscle flap for a variety of reconstructive problems.  The flap is useful for buttressing intraoral suture lines, closing intraoral defects, and providing soft tissue to fill in dead spaces and bulk out lateral and anterior oral defects.  The levator flap was found to be easy to elevate, safe, and reliable with a minimum of wound complications.  A review of 18 patients, representative case studies, and a discussion of surgical technique and relevant anatomy and blood supply is presented.",3
"Neonatal ethics: development of a consultative group.  Experience of a neonatal ethics advisory group in a tertiary care setting was reviewed to identify which aspects of the experience have been most valuable in the development of a consultative group.  Consultations were requested for 31 patients seen from August 1984 through December 1988.  Review of these patients indicated that 21 of 31 infants were born after full-term gestations, 11 of 31 infants were seen beyond the neonatal period, and some type of congenital anomaly was the principal diagnosis for 64.7% of the patients.  The reasons for seeking consultation primarily involved decisions regarding withdrawal or withholding of treatment.  For 22 of the 31 patients, the consensus of the group supported the decision of the health care team.  In the remaining consultations, the recommendation of the group was that more information and/or communication was needed.  In the analysis of the neonatal ethics advisory group's experience with consultations the characteristics of neonatal patients were identified and the value of having a forum for discussing the difficult ethical issues facing members of the health care team were validated.",15
"Dominantly inherited apathy, central hypoventilation, and Parkinson's syndrome: clinical, biochemical, and neuropathologic studies of 2 new cases.  We describe 2 new patients from a family in which 10 persons in 3 successive generations had a dominant neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by apathy, central hypoventilation, and parkinsonism.  Neuropathologically, both patients showed severe neuronal loss and reactive gliosis in the substantia nigra.  Neurochemical studies showed a marked depletion of dopamine in substantia nigra, putamen, and caudate nucleus, as well as reduction in serotonin content in the substantia nigra.  Glutamate contents were low in frontal cortex and thalamus, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) contents were low in thalamus and substantia nigra of both patients.  In addition, phosphoethanolamine contents were reduced in all brain regions of both patients, especially in the substantia nigra.  One patient with severe symptoms had low levels of homovanillic acid, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, and GABA in his CSF repeatedly for 3 years before death (aged 58), while the 2nd patient died (aged 51) of an unrelated cause before developing any symptoms of the familial disorder.  Because brain deficiencies of multiple neurotransmitters appear to be involved, this disorder is unlikely to respond to treatment; however, neurochemical studies of CSF may make presymptomatic diagnosis feasible.",9
"Purification and characterization of an inhibitor (soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor) for tumor necrosis factor and lymphotoxin obtained from the serum ultrafiltrates of human cancer patients.  Serum ultrafiltrates (SUF) from human patients with different types of cancer contain a blocking factor (BF) that inhibits the cytolytic activity of human tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in vitro.  BF is a protein with a molecular mass of 28 kDa on reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS/PAGE).  The active material was purified to homogeneity by a combination of affinity chromatography, PAGE, and high-pressure liquid chromatography.  Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that BF is derived from the membrane TNF receptor.  Purified BF blocks the lytic activity of recombinant human and mouse TNF-alpha and recombinant human lymphotoxin on murine L929 cells in vitro.  However, BF inhibits the lytic activity of TNF-alpha more effectively than it does that of lymphotoxin.  The BF also inhibits the necrotizing activity of recombinant human TNF-alpha when coinjected into established cutaneous Meth A tumors in BALB/c mice.  The BF may have an important role in (i) the regulation and control of TNF-alpha and lymphotoxin activity in cancer patients, (ii) interaction between the tumor and the host antitumor mechanisms, and (iii) use of systemically administered TNF-alpha in clinical trials with human cancer patients.",3
"Fish oil amplifies the effect of propranolol in mild essential hypertension.  Forty-seven male patients with mild essential hypertension were randomly allocated to three subgroups.  After a run-in period of 4 weeks, the first subgroup (n = 16) received propranolol (80 mg/day) for 36 weeks followed by a placebo period of 4 weeks.  The second subgroup (n = 15), after a run-in period of 4 weeks, was given a supplement of encapsulated fish oil (9 g/day) for 36 weeks with a subsequent period of 4 weeks in which fish oil placebo was given.  The third subgroup (n = 16), after a run-in period of 4 weeks, was given propranolol (80 mg/day) for 12 weeks, propranolol (80 mg/day) plus fish oil capsules (9 g/day equivalent to 1.8 g/day of eicosapentaenoic acid and 1.1 g/day of docosahexaenoic acid) for 12 weeks, propranolol plus fish oil placebo (same doses for 12 weeks) with a subsequent period of 4 weeks when propranolol placebo was administered.  The results indicate a blood pressure-lowering effect of fish oil, which was comparable with that of propranolol.  The simultaneous intake of fish oil plus propranolol was more effective than propranolol or fish oil alone.  Propranolol treatment resulted in a decrease of plasma norepinephrine, plasma renin activity, and thromboxane B2 formation.  After fish oil supplementation, plasma norepinephrine and thromboxane B2 formation were likewise reduced, whereas plasma renin activity appeared increased.  The decrease of serum triglycerides, total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol as well as the rise of high density lipoprotein cholesterol are concomitant beneficial effects, which justify the consideration of fish oil alone or in combination with antihypertensive drugs for the treatment of mild hypertension.",13
"Observer variability in the scoring of colpophotographs.  Colposcopy and cervicography are accepted tools for assessing the cervix for an atypical transformation zone.  We studied the validity of the colpophotograph as a measurement tool by determining the agreement of experienced colposcopists using colpophotographs of 50 women.  Interobserver agreement was generally fair to good (kappa greater than or equal to 0.40) for the presence of the squamocolumnar junction and the area of ectopia but it was poor (kappa less than 0.40) for the area, border, and color characteristics of an atypical transformation zone.  Intra-observer agreement was fair to good for the color characteristics of an atypical transformation zone, but it was poor for the area and border characteristics.  We conclude that observer agreement studies should play a role in the validation of methods used in the visual diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.  Considerable lack of agreement in reporting cytologic findings is a well-known problem, and lack of agreement might be an even bigger problem in reporting colposcopic findings.",22
"Prognosis of chronic granulomatous disease.  The records of 28 patients with chronic granulomatous disease born over a 32 year period were reviewed.  The characteristics of the group, and the frequency with which various clinical and laboratory features had been recorded, was assessed.  Nine patients were known to have died, in most cases of progressive suppurative infection.  Actuarial analysis showed 50% survival through the third decade of life.  The long term survival of patients developing symptoms after the end of the first year of life was significantly better than that of patients whose illness started in infancy.  Our data confirm that the severity of chronic granulomatous disease is not uniform, and that the prognosis for long term survival is better than that suggested in earlier reports.  Early onset may be a poor prognostic sign and invasive aspergillosis is a life threatening complication.  In the absence of curative treatment, trials to assess the effectiveness of interferon gamma are necessary and early antenatal diagnosis should be offered to as many affected families as possible.",14
"Relative risks of left ventricular aneurysmectomy in patients with akinetic scars versus true dyskinetic aneurysms.  From 1971 to 1988, 303 patients underwent left ventricular aneurysm resection.  We analyzed preoperative and procedure-related variables to ascertain risk factors for surgery.  A distinction was made between akinetic and dyskinetic aneurysms to assess potential relation with postoperative outcome.  Indications for surgery were arrhythmia in 20 patients, congestive heart failure in 81, angina in 133, congestive heart failure and angina in 42, and other combinations in the remaining 27 patients.  The left ventricular aneurysm was dyskinetic in 180 patients and akinetic in 121.  Risk factors and surgical procedures were similar in both groups.  Left ventricular ejection fraction was less than or equal to 30% in 98 patients.  Coronary bypass grafting was performed in 269 patients, with an average of 2.3 grafts per patient.  Mitral valve replacement, the most common concomitant procedure, was performed in 16 patients.  Intra-aortic balloon assist was required postoperatively in 47 patients.  Overall operative mortality was 13% (38 patients) and was due to low cardiac output in 23 patients and arrhythmia in 12 patients.  Univariate and multivariate analyses related early mortality to New York Heart Association functional classification of heart failure, the predominant indications of arrhythmia or congestive heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 30%, the need for intra-aortic balloon support, and the excision of an akinetic (18%) rather than dyskinetic (8%) left ventricular aneurysm.  Over a follow-up period averaging nearly 5 years, the actuarial survival at 5 years was 63% in the dyskinetic group and 51% in the akinetic group.",13
Ovarian response to exogenous gonadotropins during pregnancy.  Multiple ovarian follicles were successfully induced in a patient undergoing superovulation for a gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) procedure despite the presence of an undiagnosed ectopic pregnancy.  Midluteal gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) treatment should be coupled with mechanical contraception in the previous cycle in patients with patent tubes.,12
"The loads on the lumbar spine during work at an assembly line. The risks for fatigue injuries of vertebral bodies.  This study was performed in an attempt to determine the total spinal compressive load during assembly line work to find a possible association with the many complaints of back pain.  A flexion analyzer was used to register trunk movements, and analysis of postures and lifted weights was done from video recordings.  The load on the spine at the L3 level was calculated through a biomechanical model, meant for analysis of static, sagittally symmetric postures and lifting tasks.  Maximum lift tests were performed before and after a full work day.  The peak load on the L3-L4 level when lifting corresponded to an average 22% of the load at the lift test.  The mean load during a work cycle was 818 N.  It was concluded that the many complaints of back pain could not be attributed to high peak loads, repetitivity of the lifts, or large load doses.  Monotony, stress, and low job satisfaction are more likely factors of greater importance.",20
"Emergence of ciprofloxacin resistance in nosocomial methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates. Resistance during ciprofloxacin plus rifampin therapy for methicillin-resistant S aureus colonization.  We initiated a randomized, single-blinded trial of ciprofloxacin plus rifampin vs sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim plus rifampin in the therapy for patients who underwent colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).  Patients who were colonized with MRSA received 2 weeks of either regimen.  The study was terminated after the enrollment of 21 subjects due to the recognition of ciprofloxacin resistance in 10 of 21 new MRSA isolates during the last 2 months of the study.  Five of the 10 patients with ciprofloxacin-resistant MRSA isolates had never received ciprofloxacin.  Long-term (6-month) eradication had been achieved in only three of 11 ciprofloxacin plus rifampin and four of 10 sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim plus rifampin recipients.  The use of this new fluoroquinolone for the eradication of MRSA colonization is usually not effective and may risk the development of ciprofloxacin resistance in MRSA within the hospital environment.",0
"Growth of cultured human cerebral meningiomas is inhibited by dopaminergic agents. Presence of high affinity dopamine-D1 receptors.  We have found that microM concentrations of the dopamine agonist bromocriptine significantly decrease the proliferation rate of human meningioma cells in culture (25-56% inhibition).  This effect was also seen with direct application of dopamine, as well as the dopamine-D1 agonist (+)-SKF-38393 (both applied in microM concentrations) to meningioma cell cultures.  Receptor studies with the dopamine-D1 ligand (125I)SCH-23982 (dopamine-D1 antagonist) indicated that dopamine-D1 binding sites were present in the membranes of meningioma tissue.  The mean dissociation constant (Kd) was 325 ( +/- 74.5 SEM) pM and the receptor density (Bmax) was 25.4 ( +/- 1.5 SEM) fmol/mg pellet protein in 5 human meningiomas.  The pharmacological specificity was proven by (+)-SKF-38393, ( +/-SKF-83566 or (+)-butaclamol and their inactive isomers (-)-SKF-38393 and (-)-butaclamol in a 1000 fold excess.  These results provide evidence that human meningiomas possess high affinity dopamine-D1 receptors and that dopamine agonists have an antiproliferative effect on these tumors in culture.  We conclude that the proliferation of cerebral meningiomas may be under dopaminergic control and that dopamine agonists may have a role in the medical treatment of patients with meningiomas.",3
"Cancer of the urinary bladder in blacks and whites. A case-control study.  Racial differences in the risk of cancer of the urinary bladder associated with cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption were examined in a study of 1663 cases (1534 whites and 129 blacks) and 4930 controls matched 3:1 by sex, race, and age to the cases.  Significant increases in cancer risk associated with cigarette smoking were observed in whites and blacks; however, the dose-response patterns appeared to differ by race.  In whites, statistically significant elevations of threefold and higher were observed in the odds ratios at all smoking levels above 20 pack-years, whereas in blacks, the corresponding point estimates did not increase significantly until greater than 60 pack-years of smoking.  Although these risk patterns are compatible with the higher incidence of bladder cancer in white men, the sample of blacks was small, and tests of significance were only suggestive of higher risks for whites at specific amounts of smoking (P less than 0.15).  Effects of alcohol consumption were inconsistent, and there was no detectable synergism between smoking and drinking.  Additional study of race-specific risk factors and tobacco metabolism will be needed to determine the true nature of the apparent racial differences in the risk of urinary bladder cancer associated with cigarette smoking.",11
"Adaptation to ischemia during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Clinical, hemodynamic, and metabolic features   The clinical, electrocardiographic, and coronary hemodynamic responses to sequential 90-second occlusions of the left anterior descending coronary artery in 12 patients undergoing elective percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty were examined.  Transmyocardial lactate metabolism was examined in an additional group of seven patients with clinical and hemodynamic features similar to the first group.  We noted that in comparison with the initial balloon occlusion the second occlusion was characterized by less subjective anginal discomfort, less ST segment shift (0.44 +/- 0.13 versus 0.21 +/- 0.07 mV, p = 0.01), and lower mean pulmonary artery pressure (25 +/- 1.0 versus 20 +/- 1.7 mm Hg, p = 0.005).  In addition, for the same heart rate-blood pressure product, cardiac vein flow during the second inflation was significantly lower than that recorded during the first inflation (96 +/- 1.4 versus 83 +/- 2.4 ml/min, p = 0.005).  Finally, there was significantly less myocardial lactate production during the second inflation (lactate extraction ratio: first inflation, -0.11 +/- 0.03; second inflation, -0.03 +/- 0.02; p = 0.04).  We conclude that the lessened clinical, electrocardiographic, hemodynamic, and metabolic evidence of myocardial ischemia during the second of two periods of coronary artery occlusion during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty supports the concept of adaptation to myocardial ischemia (ischemic preconditioning).",13
"Tests of thyroid function: update in the diagnosis and management of thyroid disease.  Current thyroid function tests give the clinician powerful tools for the accurate assessment of thyroid status in the majority of patients encountered.  There are, however, a small number of clinical situations in which there appear to be inconsistencies in the interrelationship of the thyroid function tests and/or in which they are apparently inappropriate to the clinical status of the patient.  In most instances, there is a rational explanation for these observed alterations.  The application of this information should allow clinicians to further refine their diagnostic accuracy and thereby enable them to proceed with an appropriate therapeutic or management program.",18
The UCLA-University of Utah epidemiologic survey of autism: the etiologic role of rare diseases.  Twelve rare diseases known to cause CNS pathology were found in 26 (11%) of 233 autistic probands identified during a recent epidemiologic survey of Utah.  These 26 probands had significantly lower mean IQs than the remaining patients (43 versus 60) but similar sex distribution and prevalence of abnormal EEGs and seizures.  The rarity and diversity of these 12 diseases make it highly unlikely that they randomly occurred with autism.  Their presence in this epidemiologic survey is the most compelling evidence to date to support the hypothesis that different diseases producing different types of CNS pathology can play an etiologic role in autism.,9
"Experimental models for psoriasis.  Evidence suggests that inherent in skin of psoriatic subjects are cells, architectural structures, and/or mediators, which are, at a minimum, responsible for its hyperproliferative epidermis.  An objective of our laboratory has been to establish an in vitro definition of this inherent aberration.  Fibroblasts are important to epidermal proliferation/differentiation.  This, and an unconfirmed report that fibroblasts from psoriatic subjects might drive the abnormal epidermal proliferation in psoriasis, have caused further focus on the fibroblast.  Data show that fibroblasts from patients with psoriasis, both involved and uninvolved, in the presence of human serum, either normal or psoriatic, have an increased rate of proliferation.  Fibroblasts from uninvolved psoriatic sites are most responsive.  To determine if fibroblasts from psoriatics could induce the psoriasiform phenotype on normal keratinocytes, an interactive skin equivalent system has been developed.  With this system, fibroblasts from uninvolved and involved sites cause normal keratinocytes to have an enhanced outgrowth.  Uninvolved fibroblasts cause the greatest changes.  The nature of the skin equivalent system calls for this to occur via message over distance.  We conclude that fibroblasts from psoriatic subjects can induce a psoriasiform phenotype via a soluble message.",16
"Cardiac contractility and conduction: a comparison of antihypertensives.  The four classes of first-line antihypertensive agents recommended in the 1988 report of the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure are reviewed here.  Particular consideration is given to the effects of these agents on heart rate, atrioventricular nodal conduction, and myocardial contractility in patients with other cardiovascular diseases.  Diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have no significant direct effects on cardiac function.  beta-Blockers inhibit catecholamine stimulation of the heart and may be particularly beneficial in treating patients with a history of myocardial infarction.  Calcium channel blockers reduce blood pressure by dilating arterial resistance vessels.  They are structurally heterogeneous and highly selective in their sites of action.  As a consequence, cardiac effects can be minimized by selecting a calcium channel blocker with more potent peripheral vasodilatory effects.  A new calcium channel blocker, isradipine, currently undergoing clinical trials, is highly selective for arterial smooth muscle and appears to be a safe and effective antihypertensive agent.",13
"pH-adjustment and discomfort caused by the intradermal injection of lignocaine [published erratum appears in Anaesthesia 1991 Mar;46(3):242]  One hundred adult day-case patients who required intravenous access had cannulae inserted using local anaesthesia with 1% lignocaine, 1% lignocaine with adrenaline or the corresponding pH-adjusted solutions.  The local anaesthetic solutions were modified by the addition of 1 ml 8.4% sodium bicarbonate to 10 ml lignocaine.  Pain scores at different stages of cannulation were noted and showed a significant reduction after use of pH-adjusted solutions (p less than 0.02 for the plain lignocaine, and less than 0.001 for the lignocaine with adrenaline).  Modification of the pH of lignocaine solutions by the addition of sodium bicarbonate is a simple method significantly to reduce the discomfort caused by the infiltration of the local anaesthetic.",9
"Effect of epidermal growth factor in combination with sucralfate or omeprazole on the healing of chronic gastric ulcers in the rat.  Epidermal growth factor (EGF) has been shown to enhance healing of experimental gastric ulcers when given subcutaneously or orally in the drinking water.  This effect of EGF occurs without reducing gastric acid secretion.  On the other hand, EGF reportedly is excreted rapidly from gastric lumen when administered by intragastric bolus.  This suggests that further stimulation of ulcer healing may be expected if EGF is given with an acid-suppressive agent or with an agent allowing EGF to remain in rat gastric lumen at high concentrations.  In the present study, EGF administered by gastric intubation at a dose of 10 micrograms/kg, which is three times smaller than reported in previous studies, was evaluated for its effect on acetic acid-induced rat gastric ulcers in combination with sucralfate or omeprazole.  Sucralfate is well known selectively to bind proteins covering the ulcer base, and omeprazole is a potent acid-suppressive agent.  Prior to the study of combined EGF and sucralfate, oral sucralfate was confirmed to allow endogenous gastric EGF and mouse EGF given exogenously to remain at high concentrations in gastric contents and tissues.  EGF and sucralfate (2 g/kg/day) given alone failed to stimulate ulcer healing in submandibularectomized rats (SMR rat) whose endogenous gastric EGF was depleted.  However, the combination of both drugs administered at the same doses significantly accelerated ulcer healing in the SMR rat.  Omeprazole (200 mg/kg/day) significantly enhanced ulcer healing regardless of removal of the submandibular glands.  The combination of EGF and omeprazole further stimulated ulcer healing in the SMR rat.",5
"Developing improved observational methods for evaluating therapeutic effectiveness.  Therapeutic efficacy is often studied with observational surveys of patients whose treatments were selected nonexperimentally.  The results of these surveys are distrusted because of the fear that biased results occur in the absence of experimental principles, particularly randomization.  The purpose of the current study was to develop and validate improved observational study designs by incorporating many of the design principles and patient assembly procedures of the randomized trial.  The specific topic investigated was the prophylactic effectiveness of beta-blocker therapy after an acute myocardial infarction.  To accomplish the research objective, three sets of data were compared.  First, we developed a restricted cohort based on the eligibility criteria of the randomized clinical trial; second, we assembled an expanded cohort using the same design principles except for not restricting patient eligibility; and third, we used the data from the Beta Blocker Heart Attack Trial (BHAT), whose results served as the gold standard for comparison.  In this research, the treatment difference in death rates for the restricted cohort and the BHAT trial was nearly identical.  In contrast, the expanded cohort had a larger treatment difference than was observed in the BHAT trial.  We also noted the important and largely neglected role that eligibility criteria may play in ensuring the validity of treatment comparisons and study outcomes.  The new methodologic strategies we developed may improve the quality of observational studies and may be useful in assessing the efficacy of the many medical/surgical therapies that cannot be tested with randomized clinical trials.",13
"Measurements of right ventricular volumes during fluid challenge.  The effects of fluid loading on RV function were studied in 41 acutely ill patients monitored with a modified pulmonary artery catheter equipped for measuring RVef.  Hemodynamic evaluation was performed before and after infusion of 300 ml of 4.5 percent albumin solution in 30 min.  Changes in SI did not correlate with Pra or Ppao but did with RVEDVI.  For the entire group, RVef was unchanged (27 +/- 9 vs 27 +/- 9 percent).  In the eight patients with an initial RVEDVI greater than 140 ml/m2, the fluid challenge increased Pra and Ppao and reduced LVSWI without any other significant effect.  There was no significant correlation between RVEDVI and Pra and only a weak correlation between RVESVI and Ppa.  However, there was a highly linear correlation between both RVEDVI and RVESVI and changes in RVEDVI and in RVESVI, suggesting that in the absence of severe pulmonary hypertension RV output is primarily dependent on RV preload.",22
The detection of alcoholism in hospitalized schizophrenics: a comparison of the MAST and the MAC.  The Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST) and the MacAndrew Alcoholism Scale (MAC) were administered to forty-one schizophrenic inpatients also meeting DSM-III criteria for either alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence and 29 schizophrenic inpatients who did not qualify for an additional substance abuse diagnosis other than marijuana abuse/dependence.  The MAC failed to differentiate between the alcoholic and nonalcoholic groups and both groups scored above the recommended cutting score.  The MAST significantly differentiated the alcoholic and nonalcoholic schizophrenic patients and was as sensitive to a history of alcohol abuse as to alcohol dependence.  Neither the MAST nor MAC was sensitive to recent versus more remote drinking.  The overall classificatory accuracy of the MAST was found to be 80% and that of the MAC was 56%.  A logistic regression analysis revealed that the use of just four MAST items can yield a group classificatory rate of 83%.  It was concluded that the MAST exhibited sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be used as an initial screening instrument for alcoholism in schizophrenic patients.,20
"Comparison of direct and indirect measures of systemic arterial pressure during weightlifting in coronary artery disease.  Based on auscultation measurements after exercise, circuit weight training in cardiac patients has been reported to provoke minimal increases in systolic pressure.  Direct (brachial artery catheter) and indirect (sphygmomanometry) measures of blood pressure were compared at rest, during lifting with the legs (approximately the fourth, ninth and fourteenth repetition) and during 2 minutes of recovery after lifting with the arms and legs.  Subjects performed 15 repetitions of single-arm curl, single-arm military press and single- and double-leg press exercises at 40 and 60% of the maximum load that could be lifted once on a multistation weightlifting apparatus.  Indirect measures of systolic pressure at rest were 13% less than those recorded directly (130 +/- 7 vs 149 +/- 8 torr; p less than 0.01); diastolic pressures were similar using either method.  This pattern was maintained during lifting with the legs at both intensities, and after exercise with both the legs and the arms.  The mean systolic pressure recorded indirectly immediately after exercise was 63 torr (31%) and 76 torr (34%) less than the average peak intraarterial value recorded during leg and arm exercises, respectively.  The highest intraarterial pressures were generated during the final repetitions of the set; immediately after the last repetition, both systolic and diastolic pressures rapidly decreased.  It is concluded that indirect estimates of systolic pressure are significantly less than true arterial values at rest, and during and after lifting.  Moreover, indirect measurements after lifting do not allow accurate conclusions to be drawn about the arterial pressures generated during lifting because of the rapid decrease in pressure that occurs after exercise.",13
"Permeability pulmonary edema following lung resection.  The etiology of edema associated with pulmonary resection was investigated in five patients during the immediate postoperative period.  Three patients received pneumonectomy while two patients had one lobe resected.  All patients suffered from severe respiratory distress and had x-ray evidence of diffuse interstitial pulmonary edema within 12 hours of surgery.  Hemodynamic data were obtained with radial and pulmonary artery catheters.  Edema fluid was obtained along with blood samples for simultaneous determination of protein and albumin content.  All patients studied had normal or high cardiac output, normal cardiac filling pressures, and edema fluid protein to serum protein ratio of 0.6 or greater suggestive of permeability changes contributing to edema fluid accumulation.  Calculated shunt fraction exceeded 25 percent in all patients.  Pulmonary edema has been noted in patients following pulmonary resection in the early postoperative period.  In patients reviewed here, two factors appeared to be significant.  First is an increase in pulmonary capillary pressure associated with passage of a normal to high cardiac output in a reduced volume pulmonary vascular bed.  The second factor, as demonstrated by protein content in the edema fluid, is injury to the alveolar capillary membrane.",7
"Breakdown of the blood-brain barrier precedes symptoms and other MRI signs of new lesions in multiple sclerosis. Pathogenetic and clinical implications.  From an extensive serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study in multiple sclerosis (MS) we have identified 4 cases in which disruption of the blood-brain barrier, as detected by gadolinium-DTPA enhancement, preceded other MRI abnormalities and in 1 case clinical evidence of the new lesion.  This supports the view that a defect in the blood-brain barrier, and therefore inflammation, is an early and possibly crucial event in the pathogenesis of the new lesion in MS.  These cases showed a marked discrepancy between MRI abnormality and symptoms.  The mechanisms contributing to this disparity are discussed, and it is concluded that far from being surprising it is to be expected.",19
"Hodgkin's disease and CD30-positive anaplastic large cell lymphomas--a continuous spectrum of malignant disorders. A quantitative morphometric and immunohistologic study.  The authors have examined cellular areas of lymphoma tissue in 28 cases of Hodgkin's disease (HD) or anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL, 'Ki-1 cell lymphoma') to evaluate the boundaries between the two entities.  Methods applied included conventional histology; test point analysis; semiautomated morphometry of nuclear profile features of Reed-Sternberg and other atypical large cells (RSALCs); and immunohistochemistry of these elements on all paraffin sections and, in 15 cases, on frozen sections.  Mean nuclear profile morphotypes of RSALCs per case varied independently of immunophenotype and histologic diagnosis.  Conversely, immunohistochemistry demonstrated significant, although not consistent, preferential positivities of these CD30+ elements for CD15 in HD, and for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and CD43 in ALCLs.  In the latter, RSALCs also exhibited a tendency for CD45 and CD45RO positivity and for the expression of T-cell-associated antigens.  However, there were considerable overlaps.  This continuous spectrum of RSALC nuclear profile morphotypes and immunophenotypes, ranging from HD over questionable cases, intermediate between HD and ALCL, to ALCLs, was paralleled by differences in the reactive component of lymphomas.  Lymphocytes and granulocytes were significantly deficient in ALCLs.",19
"The impact of microinvasion on axillary node metastases and survival in patients with intraductal breast cancer.  A rational approach to the local treatment of intraductal breast cancer continues to generate considerable debate.  However, the finding of an invasive component in intraductal breast cancer is widely regarded as an appropriate indication for axillary node dissection as part of the local treatment and staging of this disease.  Despite this view, the natural history of patients with intraductal breast cancer with foci of microinvasion is poorly defined.  Between 1965 and 1988, 41 patients with this pathologic finding of intraductal carcinoma with foci of microinvasion were seen at the UCLA Medical Center.  Twenty-three patients presented with mammographic abnormalities, while 17 patients presented with a palpable mass.  One patient presented with Paget's disease of the nipple.  Thirty-three patients underwent axillary node dissection as part of their local treatment.  No lymph node metastases were identified.  The median follow-up in 37 patients was 47 months.  There have been no local recurrences and no deaths from recurrent breast cancer.  Intraductal breast cancer associated with microinvasion appears to be an extremely favorable lesion with minimal risk of nodal metastases.",3
"Respiratory muscle strength in congestive heart failure.  In experimental animals, conditions which drastically decrease cardiac output may reduce the strength and endurance of respiratory muscles leading to hypercapnic respiratory failure.  Because patients with chronic CHF have reduced cardiac output and vital capacity (FVC), we measured PImax and PEmax and maximal handgrip force in 16 patients with CHF and 18 AMNs.  The patients with CHF had a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 26 +/- 7 percent.  Maximal respiratory pressures were significantly reduced; group mean values (+/- SD) for PImax at FRC were 41.4 +/- 5.6 cm H2O (CHF) and 102.1 +/- 27.4 cm H2O (AMN) (p less than 0.001), with PImax values in five patients with CHF as low as 20 to 30 cm H2O.  In most patients, PEmax was comparably reduced.  Handgrip force was less dramatically reduced, suggesting selective respiratory muscle weakness.  Possible explanations include reduction in respiratory muscle blood flow or generalized muscular atrophy and weakness related to cardiac cachexia.",13
Atypical presentation of pulmonary embolism.  Today we have discussed an interesting patient with an atypical presentation of pulmonary embolism.  We have outlined a suggested algorithm to aid in the diagnosis and management of this disease.  References 8 through 24 in the reference section are suggested readings that offer further insight into the diagnosis and management of this entity.,7
"Radionuclide imaging of asymptomatic versus symptomatic total knee arthroplasties.  Ninety-eight total knee prostheses were evaluated by roentgenograms and bone scans.  Fifty-three were asymptomatic, and 45 were symptomatic.  Thirteen prostheses required revision surgery.  At a mean of 54 months, asymptomatic knee replacements generally showed only mild uptake in one or more zones.  Only one knee had uptake equal to surrounding bone.  However, symptomatic knee replacements showed significantly greater uptake in the patella, femur, and medial and lateral tibial plateau regions (Mann-Whitney two-sample rank test).  Bone scans in the symptomatic group were obtained at a mean of 44 months.  Excluding those patients who had revision surgery, the differences remained significant.  Furthermore, symptomatic knee replacements with normal roentgenograms also had significantly greater uptake.  Radiolucent lines were noted in 30% of asymptomatic patients, whereas 29% of symptomatic knees had radiolucencies.  Radiolucencies were not generally associated with significantly greater uptake.  Lateral release had no effect on the patellar score.",22
"Will sulfonylurea treatment of impaired glucose tolerance delay development and complications of NIDDM?  The chronic hyperglycemia of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) evolves gradually and is usually preceded by more transient hyperglycemia, classified as impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).  Already in this phase, there is an increased risk of cardiovascular complications, and many IGT subjects, like NIDDM patients, often display several of the metabolic and circulatory disturbances that are associated with hyperglycemia, e.g., insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia and/or hyperproinsulinemia, delayed insulin release, dyslipidemia, and hypertension.  Therefore, and because untreated hyperglycemia is a self-perpetuating condition, early detection and early intervention may be necessary to prevent the progression and complications of NIDDM.  This in turn would necessitate screening procedures, and the therapeutic goal should include both euglycemia and normalization of plasma insulin, plasma lipids, and blood pressure.  A study in the German Democratic Republic indicated that the mortality in screening-detected NIDDM patients did not differ from that in patients detected in routine care.  In a Swedish study on screening-detected NIDDM subjects, only those who had IGT rather than manifest NIDDM could maintain fasting blood glucose less than or equal to 6 mM for 5 yr by hypocaloric dietary regulation alone.  In those with screening-detected NIDDM, the delayed acute insulin release and net postprandial hyperglycemia were improved by addition of glipizide, and most managed to attain and maintain fasting blood glucose less than or equal to 6 mM for approximately 2 yr after such addition.  However, after 4 yr, there was an increase in blood glucose, suggesting that preventive intervention either may not be possible or may have to start in the IGT phase.",17
"Efficacy of recombinant-derived human superoxide dismutase on porcine left ventricular contractility after normothermic global myocardial ischemia and hypothermic cardioplegic arrest.  A porcine model of normothermic global ischemia (40 minutes) followed by systemic cooling to 25 degrees C with 4 degrees C crystalloid cardioplegic arrest (90 minutes) was used to assess the efficacy of recombinant-derived human superoxide dismutase (r-HSOD) on postreperfusion left ventricular function while on cardiopulmonary bypass.  Isovolumic hemodynamic function was monitored, and adenine nucleotide pool was measured in myocardial biopsy specimens and coronary sinus effluent.  The treatment group of pigs (n = 7) received 15 mg/kg r-HSOD immediately before warm reperfusion, both left ventricular peak systolic pressure and developed pressure were significantly better in the r-HSOD group of pigs (p less than 0.05 vs.  placebo).  This improvement persisted at 60 minutes of reperfusion (p less than 0.05 vs.  placebo).  Myocardial ATP and total adenine nucleotides did not differ, nor did adenine nucleotide catabolites in the coronary sinus effluent differ between treatment groups of pigs.  The exception to this was the nucleotide catabolite inosine, which was significantly elevated in coronary sinus effluent of pigs treated with r-HSOD at 30 minutes of reperfusion (p less than 0.05 vs.  placebo).  In this model of global ischemia and reperfusion, a recombinant-derived human free-radical scavenger provides significant protection of systolic but not diastolic function.  Values for myocardial ATP and total adenine nucleotide content suggest that the improvement in mechanical function during reperfusion is not due to enhanced preservation of myocardial bioenergetics.",13
"Treatment planning for internal radionuclide therapy: three-dimensional dosimetry for nonuniformly distributed radionuclides.  A calculational approach is described that provides the spatially varying radiation absorbed dose, presented as isodose contours superimposed on CT images, from nonuniform and/or irregular cumulated activity distributions.  CT images are read from magnetic tape and are displayed on a high-resolution color graphics display monitor.  Source tissue geometries are defined on a series of contiguous CT images automatically (by an edge detection algorithm) or manually (using a trackball), thereby obtaining a three-dimensional representation of the various source volumes of activity.  Dose calculations are performed using a radionuclide-specific absorbed dose point kernel in the form of a lookup table.  The method described yields the spatially varying dose delivered to tumor and normal tissue volumes from a patient-specific cumulated activity distribution in a clinically implementable manner.  This level of accuracy in determining normal tissue and tumor doses may prove valuable in the evaluation and implementation of radionuclides and radiolabeled compounds for therapeutic purposes.",3
"Platelet-activating factor. A putative mediator in central nervous system injury?  Platelet-activating factor (1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine) is a potent lipid autacoid produced by many cell types.  Platelet-activating factor is produced by cerebellar granule cells in culture and has been extracted from brain tissue.  Multiple platelet-activating factor receptors have been demonstrated in brain tissue.  Activation of platelet-activating factor receptors in transformed neuronal cell lines involved increases in intracellular calcium.  Platelet-activating factor has potent actions on cerebral vessels and cerebral metabolism when administered in vivo, but may not have direct effects on brain microvessels.  Excessive platelet-activating factor production in pathological states of the nervous system such as neurotrauma and stroke has been shown in only a few models (e.g., spinal cord ischemia and reperfusion or focal repercussion brain injury).  In multiple studies using highly specific and potent platelet-activating factor antagonists, reversal or prevention of key consequences of brain injury such as hypoperfusion following ischemia, reperfusion and edema, inflammatory cell accumulation, neurologic/motor deficits, and neuronal salvage were demonstrated.  This review provides and analyzes evidence in support of the role that platelet-activating factor might have in modulation of brain function and pathophysiological processes in brain ischemia and trauma.",9
"Further mapping of an ataxia-telangiectasia locus to the chromosome 11q23 region.  We recently mapped the gene for ataxia-telangiectasia group A (ATA) to chromosome 11q22-23 by linkage analysis, using the genetic markers THY1 and pYNB3.12 (D11S144).  The most likely order was cent-AT-S144-THY1.  The present paper describes further mapping of the AT locus by means of a panel of 10 markers that span approximately 60 cM in the 11q22-23 region centered around S144 and THY1.  Location scores indicate that three contiguous subsegments within the [S144-THY1] segment, as well as three contiguous segments telomeric to THY1, are each unlikely to contain the AT locus, while the more centromeric [STMY-S144] segment is most likely to contain the AT locus.  These data, together with recent refinements in the linkage and physical maps of 11q22-23, place the AT locus at 11q23.",13
"Association of elevated fasting C-peptide level and increased intra-abdominal fat distribution with development of NIDDM in Japanese-American men.  The Japanese-American population of King County, Washington, is known to have a high prevalence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).  As part of a community-based study, we reexamined 146 second-generation Japanese-American men who had been initially classified as nondiabetic.  At a mean follow-up period of 30 mo, 15 men had developed NIDDM, and 131 remained nondiabetic.  The variables measured at the initial visit that distinguished the 15 diabetic men from the 131 nondiabetic men were older age, higher serum glucose level at 2 h after 75 g oral glucose, higher fasting plasma C-peptide level, and increased cross-sectional intra-abdominal fat area as determined by computed tomography.  Both older age and higher 2-h glucose levels are variables that have been associated with the development of NIDDM, but the association of higher fasting C-peptide level and greater intra-abdominal fat area with subsequent development of NIDDM were new observations.  The elevated fasting C-peptide level persisted after adjustment for fasting serum glucose.  The elevated C-peptide level represents hypersecretion of insulin and was interpreted to reflect a compensatory response to an underlying insulin-resistant state that antedates the development of NIDDM.  The fasting C-peptide level was correlated with the intra-abdominal fat area, suggesting that the intra-abdominal fat area may be associated with insulin resistance.  Thus, in individuals who develop NIDDM, insulin resistance, increased insulin secretion, and increased intra-abdominal fat are present before diabetic glucose tolerance can be demonstrated.",17
"Serum concentration of soluble interleukin-2 receptor as a sensitive parameter of disease activity in sarcoidosis.  We investigated the clinical value of measuring serum concentrations of soluble IL-2R in monitoring sarcoidosis.  Serum concentrations of soluble IL-2R were measured in 70 patients with sarcoidosis.  The mean value for active untreated sarcoidosis was 1,143 +/- 509 U/ml, while the normal range in 97 healthy control subjects was 80 to 300 U/ml.  The mean value for active untreated sarcoidosis was significantly higher than that for dormant disease (353 +/- 183 U/ml) or that for corticosteroid-treated patients (380 +/- 151 U/ml).  Serial changes in serum soluble IL-2R level were studied in cases of spontaneous remission or in corticosteroid-treated patients; a good correlation was noted between the changes in serum level of soluble IL-2R and clinical status.  A positive correlation was noted between serum concentration of soluble IL-2R and serum ACE activity.  These data confirmed that measurement of serum concentration of soluble IL-2R could be used in monitoring the disease activity in sarcoidosis.",14
"Effects of repetitive administration of corticotropin-releasing hormone combined with lysine vasopressin on plasma adrenocorticotropin and cortisol levels in secondary adrenocortical insufficiency.  To examine the functioning of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis in secondary adrenocortical insufficiency, we administered 100 micrograms synthetic human CRH, iv, plus 10 U lysine-8-vasopressin (LVP), im, three times daily for 3 consecutive days.  The changes in plasma ACTH and cortisol levels during the administration and the response to an insulin tolerance test (ITT) conducted before and after the administration were determined.  In three patients with isolated ACTH deficiency, basal plasma ACTH and cortisol levels were undetectablly low, and there was no response noted in the ITT or during CRH-LVP administration throughout the observation period.  In four patients with adrenocortical insufficiency who had undergone successful transsphenoidal microadenomectomy for Cushing's disease and in six patients who had undergone curative unilateral adrenalectomy for Cushing's syndrome, basal plasma ACTH levels were low, but responded considerably to both stimulation tests.  Along with the 3 days of CRH-LVP stimulation, however, neither the peak nor the time-integrated ACTH response was significantly enhanced, because of the variability of the responses among the patients.  Compared with the ACTH response on the last day of CRH-LVP stimulation, the subsequent ITT tended to induce a lower ACTH response in the post-Cushing's disease patients and a higher response in the post-Cushing's syndrome patients.  Regarding the plasma cortisol levels, the basal, peak, and integrated responses tended to increase daily during CRH-LVP administration.  Conversely, the ITT after repetitive CRH-LVP administration induced a higher cortisol response than the test before CRH-LVP administration in the post-Cushing's disease patients.  No serious complications were noted in any of the patients during or after the treatment.  The present findings indicate that 1) repetitive administration of CRH in combination with LVP is a safe and valuable provocation test to examine the pituitary ACTH reserve and the integrity of the pituitary-adrenocortical axis; 2) isolated ACTH deficiency is usually due to a defect at the pituitary level; 3) with respect to adrenocortical responsiveness, post-Cushing's disease patients show a better accumulation of the provocative effect than do post-Cushing's syndrome patients; and 4) both hypothalamic and pituitary dysfunction are responsible for adrenal hypofunction in patients after hypercortisolemia, but post-Cushing's syndrome patients (especially those with a short period of hypercortisolemia) appeared to have less impairment of hypothalamic ACTH-releasing activity than post-Cushing's disease patients.",18
"Reduced insulinotropic effects of glucagonlike peptide I-(7-36)-amide and gastric inhibitory polypeptide in isolated perfused diabetic rat pancreas.  The pathophysiological role of incretin in diabetes mellitus has not been established.  We therefore examined the effects of glucagonlike peptide I-(7-36)-amide (truncated GLP-I) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) on insulin and glucagon release from isolated perfused pancreases of diabetic rats (12-14 wk of age, mean +/- SE fasting plasma glucose 8.9 +/- 0.6 mM, n = 25) after an injection of 90 mg/kg streptozocin on the 2nd day after birth and compared the results with those of nondiabetic control rats.  In diabetic rats, the infusion of 1 nM GLP-I or GIP in perfusates with varying glucose concentrations (2.8, 5.6, 8.3, 11.1, or 22.2 mM) caused a nearly equal degree of insulin stimulation from a similar basal insulin level.  Meanwhile, basal and GLP-I- or GIP-stimulated insulin release increased in correlation with the ambient glucose concentration in nondiabetic rats.  The degree of stimulation of insulin release at glucose concentrations of 5.6 mM in diabetic rats was approximately 33% that of nondiabetic rats.  The stimulation potency was the same between GLP-I and GIP.  The insulin treatment for diabetic rats (5 U/kg NPH insulin at 0900 and 2100 for 6 days) brought only a slight improvement in the glucose dependency of GLP-I-stimulated insulin release.  The effects of GLP-I and GIP on glucagon release were completely opposite.  GLP-I suppressed release; GIP stimulated it.  In diabetic rats, the degree of suppression by GLP-I and stimulation by GIP were almost the same with similar basal glucagon levels in the perfusate with varying glucose concentrations.",17
"Impact of intrauterine growth retardation and body proportionality on fetal and neonatal outcome.  Previous prognostic studies of infants with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) have not adequately considered the heterogeneity of IUGR in terms of cause, severity, and body proportionality and have been prone to misclassification of IUGR because of errors in estimation of gestational age.  Based on a cohort of 8719 infants with early-ultrasound-validated gestational ages and indexes of body proportionality standardized for birth weight, the consequences of severity and cause-specific IUGR and proportionality for fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality were assessed.  With progressive severity of IUGR, there were significant (all P less than .001) linear trends for increasing risks of stillbirth, fetal distress (abnormal electronic fetal heart tracings)O during parturition, neonatal hypoglycemia (minimum plasma glucose less than 40 mg/dL), hypocalcemia (minimum Ca less than 7 mg/dL), polycythemia (maximum capillary hemoglobin greater than or equal to 21 g/dL), severe depression at birth (manual ventilation greater than 3 minutes), 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores less than or equal to 6, 1-minute Apgar score less than or equal to 3, and in-hospital death.  These trends persisted for the more common outcomes even after restriction to term (37 to 42 weeks) births.  There was no convincing evidence that outcome among infants with a given degree of growth retardation varied as a function of cause of that growth retardation.  Among infants with IUGR, increased length-for-weight had significant crude associations with hypoglycemia and polycythemia, but these associations disappeared after adjustment for severity of growth retardation and gestational age.",15
"Differential roles of opioid receptors in respiration, respiratory disease, and opiate-induced respiratory depression.  In summary, these findings indicate the importance of designing future experiments that delineate between opioid and nonopioid forms of respiratory disease and dysfunction, and the need to identify means of diagnosing them in order to achieve successful recovery.  Apparently there is great diversity between animal species in terms of contributions of endogenous opioids to tonic control of ventilation, and future work should strive to identify which species is most appropriate as a model of human ventilatory control and disease.  Certain opioid receptor types appear to be linked to independent respiratory functions.  For instance, mu receptors in the brain stem produce strong inhibitory actions on respiratory parameters, including RR, VT, VE, and CO2 sensitivity.  These effects have been observed in vivo and by electrophysiologic recordings in vitro.  Delta receptors may also exert some inhibitory effect on respiration, especially in the NTS.  In the CNS, the ventral surfaces of the medulla and pons, especially the NTS and NA, seem to be important sites for opioid-induced inhibition of respiration, whereas the spinal cord probably is not involved in opioid-mediated ventilatory depression.  Kappa receptors appear to be devoid of respiratory depressant activity, whereas sigma receptors may stimulate some ventilatory parameters.  Morphine and similar pure mu agonists, such as fentanyl and oxymorphine, probably produce their analgesic and respiratory depressant effects through stimulation of mu receptors.  Mixed agonists/antagonists that have mu antagonist (or partial agonist) activity plus kappa agonist and/or sigma agonist activity show a ceiling effect for respiratory depression.  Future tests need to determine which opioid receptor may be responsible for the ceiling effect.  In addition, the effects of mu, delta, kappa, and sigma selective agonists on hypoxic drive should also be determined, as a drug that stimulates hypoxic sensitivity in the face of hypercapnic depression may produce less overall respiratory depression due to counteractive effects.  In the future, clinically optimal opiates should have more specificity of action than those available now.  This may be achieved by creating drugs selective for single receptors or by creating drugs with desirable combinations of receptor selectivities.  The combinations of mixed agonists/antagonists with pure mu agonists currently in use today are promising, as they provide analgesia with reduced respiratory depression.  In the early days of opiate research and development, combination drug regimens were thoroughly tested to determine the ""ideal ratios"" that would retain analgesic properties but not the other undesirable effects such as respiratory depression (196).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).",7
"Increased transcapillary escape rate of albumin in nondiabetic men in response to hyperinsulinemia.  Diabetic patients manifest increased vascular permeability.  To determine whether insulin per se might increase vascular permeability, five nondiabetic men were studied by the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique.  Each subject received a 0.72-nmol/kg body wt i.v.  insulin bolus, followed by a 72-pmol.kg-1.min-1 insulin infusion for 4 h.  Euglycemia was maintained by the Biostator glucose controller.  At 7 h of study, 10 microCi i.v.  125I-labeled albumin was injected as bolus dose.  Frequent blood samples were drawn during the next 70 min for determination of the transcapillary escape rate (TER) of albumin.  Subjects returned 1-2 wk later for a control study, during which 0.45% saline was infused at a rate identical to the dextrose and insulin infusion rates during the hyperinsulinemic clamp.  The mean +/- SE serum insulin levels during the hyperinsulinemic clamp and saline infusion were 9786 +/- 126 and 46 +/- 4 pM, respectively, whereas serum glucose during the two sessions was similar (5.0 +/- 0.2 vs.  4.8 +/- 0.1 mM, NS).  Identical fluid volumes were infused during the two sessions (1767 +/- 197 ml/7 h), and urine outputs did not differ significantly (1615 +/- 309 vs.  1035 +/- 248 ml/7 h).  The TER of albumin was greater in all five men after hyperinsulinemia than after saline infusion (18.3 +/- 2.7 vs.  -2.8 +/- 2.3%/h, P = 0.01).",18
"Cardiac abnormalities in children with sickle cell anemia.  The cardiac status of 64 children (ages 0.2 to 18 yr) with sickle cell anemia documented by hemoglobin electrophoresis was evaluated by echocardiography.  Left atrial, left ventricular and aortic root dimensions were significantly increased in over 60 percent of these children at all ages compared to values for 99 normal black (non-SCA) control subjects.  Left ventricular wall thickness was increased in only 20 percent of older children with sickle cell anemia.  Estimated LV mass/m2 and left ventricular cardiac index were increased compared to control subjects (p less than 0.001).  Left heart abnormalities expressed as a single composite function, derived from multivariate regression analysis, correlated well with severity of anemia expressed as grams of hemoglobin (r = -0.52, p = less than 0.001) and with percentage of hemoglobin S (r = 0.51, p less than 0.001), but not to the same extent with age.  Echocardiographically assessed left ventricular function at rest was comparable to that of control subjects.  These data suggest that the major cardiac abnormalities in children are related to the volume overload effects of chronic anemia, and that in this age group, there is no evidence for a distinct ""sickle cell cardiomyopathy"" or cardiac dysfunction.",14
"An interdisciplinary nutrition assessment and intervention protocol for children with disabilities.  Because of the multifactorial nature of the nutrition problems associated with developmental disabilities, a well-organized, interdisciplinary effort is necessary to deal with such problems.  A team composed of professional and support staff, the client, and the family needs to be involved in an integrated approach to service.  The team members share their knowledge and expertise in developing an individual program plan to meet identified needs.  This article describes the development and implementation of a prototype for interdisciplinary nutritional evaluation and intervention in an outpatient setting.  In 1987, a Regional Nutrition and Feeding Diagnosis and Evaluation Clinic was established through a contractual agreement between the University of Georgia University Affiliated Program and St.  Mary's Hospital in Athens, GA.  The purposes of the clinic are twofold: to offer direct services to developmentally disabled infants and children who require outpatient services and to provide a unique community-based interdisciplinary training experience for graduate students in nutrition and other health disciplines.  The interdisciplinary treatment protocol is based on current knowledge in the treatment of developmental disabilities.",22
"Regional chemotherapy for colorectal liver metastases: a phase II evaluation of targeted hepatic arterial 5-fluorouracil for colorectal liver metastases.  The results of systemic chemotherapy in patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer remain dismal.  Regional chemotherapy has been advocated as a method of improving the delivery of cytotoxic drugs to tumour, while minimizing systemic toxicity.  The use of vasoactive agents to redistribute arterial blood flow towards tumour, and of biodegradable microspheres to slow tumour blood flow, have also been suggested as methods of further improving tumour exposure to drug.  We present 21 patients who received intrahepatic arterial chemotherapy for colorectal liver metastases.  Combined treatment (angiotensin II, albumin microspheres and 5-fluorouracil) was administered 4-6 weekly, and bolus 5-fluorouracil was given in the intervening weeks.  Toxicity was minimal.  Responses were seen in seven patients.  Fewer than half of the deaths were from liver metastases; a quarter of the patients died from non-cancer-related causes.  Survival was prolonged in the treated group compared with historical controls.  These results suggest that this regimen has activity in patients with colorectal liver metastases.",3
"Structure, expression and function of a schwannoma-derived growth factor.  During the development of the nervous system, cells require growth factors that regulate their division and survival.  To identify new growth factors, serum-free growth-conditioned media from many clonal cell lines were screened for the presence of mitogens for central nervous system glial cells.  A cell line secreting a potent glial mitogen was established from a tumour (or 'schwannoma') derived from the sheath of the sciatic nerve.  The cells of the tumour, named JS1 cells, were adapted to clonal culture and identified as Schwann cells.  Schwann cells secrete an autocrine mitogen and human schwannoma extracts have mitogenic activity on glial cells.  Until now, neither mitogen has been purified.  Here we report the purification and characterization of a mitogenic molecule, designated schwannoma-derived growth factor (SDGF), from the growth-conditioned medium of the JS1 Schwann cell line.  SDGF belongs to the epidermal growth factor family, and is an autocrine growth factor as well as a mitogen for astrocytes, Schwann cells and fibroblasts.",9
Bilious pleural effusion following liver biopsy.  Pleural effusions in patients with chronic liver disease are common and usually are of little consequence.  Bilious pleural effusion can occur following percutaneous biopsy or cholangiography procedures if the pleura is traversed.  This report emphasizes the role of biliary tract obstruction in the development of a bilious effusion and the importance of biliary tract decompression in treatment.  We discuss the laboratory evidence supporting the diagnosis of bilious effusion and review the reported experience with this complication.,7
"High dietary fiber and low saturated fat intake among oligomenorrheic undergraduates.  Numerous functional risk factors are associated with the occurrence of secondary amenorrhea in young women.  Less is known regarding factors associated with the more prevalent problem of oligomenorrhea.  We have evaluated nutrient intake, body composition, perceived psychological stress, 24-hour urinary cortisol, and urinary C peptide (UCP) in 35 eumenorrheic, 11 mildly oligomenorrheic, and 10 oligomenorrheic nonathletic undergraduate women.  Nutrient intake was evaluated by a validated food frequency questionnaire.  Oligomenorrheic women were found to consume significantly more dietary fiber, crude fiber, and polyunsaturated fat, and significantly less saturated fat than their eumenorrheic classmates.  Oligomenorrheic women had significantly lower 24-hour UCP excretion than mildly oligomenorrheic women.  The groups did not differ in any aspect of body composition, body weight, age of menarche, perceived psychological stress, or urinary cortisol excretion.  The data suggest that higher intake of fiber and lower intake of saturated fat may be associated with oligomenorrhea among otherwise healthy undergraduate nonathletic women.",22
"Selective management of early glottic cancer.  Seventy patients with stage I and II glottic cancer were treated at the University of Utah School of Medicine hospitals from 1980 through 1987.  Forty-four patients had stage I cancer and 26 patients had stage II.  The overall survival in the stage I group was 82%.  Primary site control was 93% with only three deaths due to laryngeal cancer.  Local control rates were 93% with CO2 laser excision, 80% with CO2 laser and irradiation, and 67% with radiation alone.  Stage II glottic patients had an overall survival of 61.5% with a local control rate of 76%.  Twenty-one of 24 patients were treated by full-course irradiation.  Of the eight patients who recurred at the primary site, all were irradiation failures who had initial bulky disease and impaired vocal cord mobility.  Selective CO2 laser excision was highly effective, whereas radiation therapy results were somewhat disappointing.  Open partial laryngectomy should be considered in bulky stage II disease patients.",8
"Free radical inhibition and serial chemiluminescence in evolving experimental pancreatitis.  Oxygen free radical activity and inhibition were examined in experimental pancreatitis.  Twenty-five rats were randomized to five groups: controls received intravenous saline, to simulate pancreatitis one group received intravenous caerulein (5 micrograms kg-1 h-1), and three groups received sodium taurocholate via the pancreatic duct (0.2 ml, 5 per cent), either alone, following allopurinol or immediately before superoxide dismutase.  Chemiluminescence (a phenomenon based on the emission of light during chemical reactions and which is dependent on oxygen free radical activity) was used as an index of oxygen free radical activity and was measured in tissue samples at 5-min intervals following induction of pancreatitis.  The control mean(s.e.m.) serum amylase level 1 h after induction of pancreatitis was 635(13) units.  It was significantly elevated in caerulein-induced pancreatitis, 1833(118) units (P less than 0.05) and exceeded 3000 units in all taurocholate-infused animals.  Mean(s.e.m.) chemiluminescence ranged from 44 (8) mV 100 mg-1 at time zero to 404(113) mV 100 mg-1 at 1 h in controls.  In caerulein-induced pancreatitis mean(s.e.m.) chemiluminescence peaked at 20 min (1399(239) mV 100 mg-1, P less than 0.02) and in taurocholate-induced pancreatitis at 15 min (2316(95) mV 100 mg-1, P less than 0.004).  Superoxide dismutase significantly reduced chemiluminescence and hyperamylasaemia in taurocholate groups.  Increasing oxygen free radical activity paralleled evolving pancreatitis.  Superoxide dismutase may have a therapeutic role in pancreatitis.",5
"Corticosteroid treatment reduces mast cell numbers in inflammatory bowel disease.  Mast cell degranulation in the gut causes mucus secretion, mucosal edema, and increased gut permeability and may be responsible for some of the symptoms and signs of inflammatory bowel disease.  We have used a novel monoclonal antibody (AAI) against tryptase expressed exclusively in the granules of mast cells to enumerate mast cells in rectal biopsies in order to study the effect of inflammatory bowel disease and drug treatment upon rectal mast cell numbers.  Rectal mast cell numbers are significantly reduced in inflammatory bowel disease patients taking corticosteroids (mean 4.95 cells/mm2) when compared with control patients (10.1, P less than 0.001) and inflammatory bowel disease patients not taking corticosteroids (9.7, P less than 0.001 Wilcoxon rank sum test).  The reduction in mast cell counts was independent of the degree of inflammation or architectural distortion.  There was a negative correlation between the dose of corticosteroids and mast cell count (r = 0.53, P less than 0.05 Spearman rank correlation), and the mast cell count was reduced within a few days of treatment and remained low throughout steroid therapy.  Mucosal mast cell depletion may be an important mechanism of action of corticosteroids in inflammatory bowel disease.",5
"Mortality after 10 1/2 years for hypertensive participants in the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial   The Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) is a randomized primary prevention trial that tested the effect of a multifactor intervention program on coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality in 12,866 high-risk men aged 35-57 years.  Men were randomly assigned to either a special intervention (SI) program, which consisted of dietary advice for lowering blood cholesterol levels, counseling aimed at cessation for cigarette smokers, and stepped-care treatment for hypertension for those with elevated blood pressure, or to their usual sources of health care within the community (UC).  Among the 12,866 randomized men, 8,012 (62%) were hypertensive at baseline.  For this subgroup, mortality rates with 10.5 years of follow-up were lower for the SI than for the UC group by 15% (p = 0.19) for CHD and 11% (p = 0.13) for all causes.  These results reflected more favorable outcomes for SI compared with UC hypertensive men during the 3.8 posttrial years (March 1982 through December 1985) than during the preceding 6-8 years (through February 1982).  During the posttrial years, death rates were lower for SI than for UC men by 26% (p = 0.09) for CHD and 23% (p = 0.02) for all causes.  For those with diastolic blood pressure equal to or more than 100 mm Hg, this posttrial trend was a continuation of a trend during the trial; therefore, with 10.5 years of follow-up, death rates were markedly lower for SI than for UC by 36% (p = 0.07) for CHD and 50% (p = 0.0001) for all causes.  Similarly, for those without baseline resting electrocardiographic abnormalities, the favorable posttrial outcome for the SI group was a continuation of a trend during the trial.  In contrast, for those with baseline diastolic blood pressure of 90-99 mm Hg and for those with baseline resting electrocardiographic abnormalities, the favorable posttrial mortality findings for the SI group were a reversal of unfavorable trends recorded during the trial.  Two factors appear to have contributed to this more favorable mortality trend for the SI group: 1) a change in the diuretic treatment protocol for SI men about 5 years after randomization, which involved replacement of hydrochlorothiazide with chlorthalidone at a daily maximum dose of 50 mg; and 2) a favorable effect of intervention on nonfatal cardiovascular events during the trial years.  In addition, delay until the full impact of beneficial effects on mortality end points from smoking cessation and cholesterol lowering could have contributed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).",13
"Magnitude and time course of beta-adrenergic antagonism during oral amiodarone therapy.  To examine the presence and time course of beta-adrenergic antagonism produced by amiodarone, the heart rate, QT interval and arrhythmia frequency in response to graded doses of isoproterenol were evaluated in eight patients treated with oral amiodarone for sustained ventricular tachycardia.  Measurements were made before and every 2 days after beginning oral amiodarone therapy (600 mg twice daily).  Isoproterenol was given in doses of 12.5, 25 and 50 ng/kg body weight per min.  The mean heart rate at rest decreased from 73.1 +/- 17.8 beats/min on day 0 to 57.8 +/- 15.0 beats/min after 12 days of amiodarone therapy.  A significant linear decline in heart rate at rest was observed until day 6 (p less than 0.05 for all comparisons).  On all days isoproterenol produced a progressive increase in heart rate that reached 115.5 +/- 20.2 beats/min on day 0 and 94.2 +/- 18.5 beats/min on day 12.  Amiodarone blunted the heart rate increase produced by isoproterenol on days 2 to 12 (p less than 0.05 versus day 0).  This effect was present by day 2 and did not change significantly thereafter.  The mean corrected QT (QTc) interval increased from 430 +/- 30 ms on day 0 to 449 +/- 63 ms on day 12.  A significant linear increase in QTc interval was observed until day 6 (p less than 0.05 for all comparisons).  There was no systematic effect of isoproterenol on the QTc interval.  Five of eight patients had a significant number of isoproterenol-induced premature ventricular complexes.  Ventricular ectopic activity in response to isoproterenol was abolished after 4 days of amiodarone therapy.",13
"Effect of procaterol on arterial blood gas in asthmatic children.  We determined changes in arterial blood gas after the inhalation of procaterol, a highly beta 2-selective and long-acting adrenergic agonist, in 11 asthmatic children.  Seven of the patients, with a maximum fall of 14 mmHg (63.6%), showed a decrease in PaO2 (mean +/- SD = -7.1 +/- 4.0 mmHg) and had poorer pulmonary function with a lower initial PaO2 than four subjects who had an increase in PaO2 after inhalation.  There was a statistically significant correlation between values of the PaO2 before and after inhalation (P less than .05).",19
"Metabolism of human gliomas: assessment with H-1 MR spectroscopy and F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET   Localized hydrogen-1 magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy and fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) were employed to obtain metabolic information from intracranial gliomas.  Advantages and difficulties associated with comparison of results from the two modalities were realized.  Forty patients were studied with H-1 MR spectroscopy.  MR signal intensities from lactate, N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline, and creatine from a volume of interest containing the tumor and a contralateral volume were obtained and evaluated.  NAA signal intensities were generally decreased in the tumor spectra, and choline signal intensities were elevated.  H-1 MR spectroscopy was unsuccessful in eight patients, and FDG PET scans were not obtained in four of the patients with successful MR spectroscopic examinations.  Lactate signal intensity was detected in 10 of the 28 patients who had successful H-1 MR spectroscopic and FDG PET studies.  Lactate signal intensities were observed in lesions shown at FDG PET to be hypermetabolic, as well as in lesions found to be hypometabolic.",3
"Tissue, developmental, and tumor-specific expression of divergent transcripts in Wilms tumor.  The Wilms tumor locus on chromosome 11p13 has been mapped to a region defined by overlapping, tumor-specific deletions.  Complementary DNA clones representing transcripts of 2.5 (WIT-1) and 3.5 kb (WIT-2) mapping to this region were isolated from a kidney complementary DNA library.  Expression of WIT-1 and WIT-2 was restricted to kidney and spleen.  RNase protection revealed divergent transcription of WIT-1 and WIT-2, originating from a DNA region of less than 600 bp.  Both transcripts were present at high concentrations in fetal kidney and at much reduced amounts in 5-year-old and adult kidneys.  Eleven of 12 Wilms tumors classified as histopathologically heterogeneous exhibited absent or reduced expression of WIT-2, whereas only 4 of 14 histopathologically homogeneous tumors showed reduced expression.  These data demonstrate a molecular basis for the pathogenetic heterogeneity in Wilms tumorigenesis.",11
"A 170-kDa membrane-bound protease is associated with the expression of invasiveness by human malignant melanoma cells.  Malignant spreading of cancer cells requires cell surface proteases that cleave the crosslinked collagenous matrix of connective tissues.  From correlating the morphologically defined invasiveness of tumor cells with the presence of specific membrane-associated proteases, we have identified a malignant human melanoma cell line, LOX, that invades crosslinked gelatin films in vitro and contains uniquely a neutral 170-kDa gelatinase in the cell membrane.  A similar gelatinase was found in membranes recovered from culture media conditioned with LOX.  The 170-kDa gelatinase is a wheat germ agglutinin-binding protein.  The proteolytic activity is maximal at neutral pH, enhanced by EDTA and dithiothreitol, inhibited by the cysteine protease inhibitors N-ethylmaleimide, HgCl2, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and can bind to an organomercurial adsorbent, suggesting that it is a neutral sulfhydryl-sensitive protease.  This 170-kDa gelatinase of LOX cells was not found in a control melanoma cell line, SK-MEL28, or in 32 other tumor cell lines that did not show extracellular gelatin degradation.  Thus, we have identified a large membrane-bound protease that may be a specific marker molecule for melanoma cell invasiveness.",3
"Effects of ketamine on the cardiac papillary muscle of normal hamsters and those with cardiomyopathy.  The effect of ketamine (10(-5) and 10(-4) M) on the intrinsic contractility of left ventricular papillary muscle from normal hamsters and those with cardiomyopathy (BIO 82.62, 6-month old) was investigated.  At these concentrations, ketamine induced a positive inotropic effect on normal papillary muscle, as shown by an increase in maximum unloaded shortening velocity (+19 +/- 4 and +34 +/- 5%, P less than 0.05), active isometric force (+32 +/- 8 and +57 +/- 11%, P less than 0.05), and peak power output (+40 +/- 8 and +80 +/- 16%, P less than 0.05), and induced a slight decrease in sarcoplasmic reticulum function.  Ketamine had no effect on the curvature of the total force-velocity curve, suggesting that it does not modify myothermal economy.  Contractility of papillary muscle from hamsters with cardiomyopathy was less than that of controls, as shown by the decrease in isometric active force (-41%, P less than 0.02), peak power output (-33%, P less than 0.05), and sarcoplasmic reticulum function.  The positive inotropic effect of ketamine on papillary muscle from hamsters with cardiomyopathy was less marked than in controls and almost suppressed in some cases: only the maximum unloaded shortening velocity was significantly increased with 10(-5) M ketamine (+7 +/- 6%, P less than 0.05), whereas no significant changes were observed in active isometric force (+14 +/- 8 and +13 +/- 11%; nonsignificant [NS]) and peak power output (+9 +/- 5 and +13 +/- 8%; NS) with ketamine (10(-5) and 10(-4) M, respectively).",13
"Pain in children.  The assessment and management of children's pain is a topic that has received a great deal of attention since the late 1970s.  Nurse researchers have played a dominant role in all areas of pediatric pain relief and likely will continue to do so.  There are currently a number of pediatric pain assessment instruments developed that are used in selected practice settings, but their use should be extended to document the existence of pediatric pain and its relief.  Pharmacologic interventions for pediatric pain relief have been hampered by incorrect beliefs about analgesic risks, prescribing and administrating habits, and a virtual explosion of information in the area of analgesics.  Although nurses have traditionally used nonpharmacologic interventions for pain relief, these methods have not been well researched.  Continued research efforts in this important area will result in improved diagnosis and management of pediatric pain.",9
"Bone loss in the distal anterior femur after total knee arthroplasty.  Bone loss in the distal anterior femur in asymptomatic total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients has been noted roentgenographically and during revision surgery.  A retrospective roentgenographic review of 147 TKA cases was carried out to document bone loss.  The influence that the mode of fixation (porous coated and cemented) and the implant design have on bone loss was examined.  The time of onset and the progression of bone loss were studied.  Bone loss occurred in the distal anterior femur in the majority of cases reviewed (68%).  The prevalence of bone loss was independent of the mode of fixation and the implant design.  By qualitative observation, roentgenographically detectable bone loss occurred within the first postoperative year and did not progress further.  Previously three-dimensional finite element analysis demonstrated that the replacement of the bearing surface of the femur with a stiff metallic implant reduces the stress in the distal anterior femur by at least one order of magnitude.  It is therefore speculated that the observed bone loss results from stress shielding.  The apparent lack of progression may reflect the development of a new remodeling equilibrium under the altered stress conditions.  The bone loss in the distal anterior femur described has not been implicated as a source of failure.  However, since the bone strength in the femoral region is compromised as it becomes osteopenic, bone failure may occur with longer periods of cyclic loading.  Furthermore, as a result of bone loss, revision arthroplasty may be more difficult.",4
"Breathing exercises for the medical patient: the art and the science.  The art of breathing exercises can be traced to the late 1800s.  In the past 10 years, the increased demand for treatment for respiratory muscle failure of dysfunction has resulted in numerous studies evaluating methods of treatment or training.  This article provides an overview of research and practice, focused on treating the medical patient experiencing dyspnea or loss of respiratory muscle strength and endurance.",7
"Tracheotomy in the first year of life.  Much has been written concerning complications of pediatric tracheotomies, but few studies have reviewed the complication rates of tracheotomies performed in the first 12 months of life.  We reviewed the records of 60 patients who underwent tracheotomy in the first year of life between 1976 and 1988.  This study includes 30 full-term infants and 30 premature infants, 16 of whom were very low birth weight preterm infants (less than or equal to 32 weeks' gestation and less than 1,500 g birth weight).  Overall complication rates were 3% intraoperative, 13% early postoperative, and 38% late postoperative.  The early postoperative complication rate in preterm infants was nearly double that of full-term infants.  The late postoperative complication rate of patients undergoing tracheotomy for airway obstruction was more than double that of patients requiring tracheotomy for pulmonary indications.  Duration of tracheotomy, however, was felt to be the most important factor in the development of a late postoperative complication.",22
"Bactericidal effect of doxycycline associated with lysosomotropic agents on Coxiella burnetii in P388D1 cells.  There is no consistently reliable treatment for endocarditis resulting from chronic Coxiella burnetii infection, the causative agent of Q fever.  Although certain antibiotics are recommended on the basis of their in vitro bactericidal activities, results of therapy with these antibiotics are often disappointing.  To evaluate whether the currently recommended antibiotic susceptibility tests for C.  burnetii give misleading results because of continued division of uninfected cells, thereby resulting in the dilution of infected cells and, hence, a false picture of antibiotic efficacy, we blocked cell division during antibiotic susceptibility testing with cycloheximide.  Using this new method, we found that the currently recommended antibiotics for the treatment of Q fever, doxycycline, pefloxacin, and rifampin, did not reduce the ratio of infected to noninfected cells (either L929 or P388D1) by 9 days postinfection.  To test the hypothesis that this lack of antibacterial activity is due to antibiotic inactivation by the low pH of the phagolysosomes in which C.  burnetii is found, we used alkalinizing lysosomotropic agents (chloroquine or amantadine) concurrently with doxycycline.  This resulted in the sterilization of C.  burnetii infection in P388D1 cells.  This finding seems to confirm our suspicion that the acidic conditions of the phagolysosomes in which C.  burnetii is located inhibit antibiotic activity.  This inhibition can be reversed in vitro when lysosomotropic alkalinizing agents are used.",3
"Rhabdomyosarcomas in the head and neck: MR imaging evaluation.  To determine the typical magnetic resonance (MR) signal intensity characteristics of rhabdomyosarcomas, short repetition time (TR)/short echo time (TE) (T1-weighted) and long TR (proton density and T2-weighted) images of 13 patients with rhabdomyosarcomas of the head and neck were retrospectively reviewed.  Seven patients received gadopentetate dimeglumine injections.  The most common MR appearance was that of a homogeneous mass, hyperintense to both muscle and fat on long TR/long TE images and isointense or minimally hyperintense to muscle on short TR/short TE images.  All lesions of the patients who received gadopentetate dimeglumine enhanced markedly.  Two lesions had intratumoral hemorrhage, and six were markedly heterogeneous in signal intensity.  Similar MR signal intensity patterns have been described for lymphomas and nasopharyngeal carcinomas.  The forte of MR imaging lies in its ability to delineate precisely the extent of the rhabdomyosarcoma.",3
"Wounding effects of the AK-47 rifle used by Patrick Purdy in the Stockton, California, schoolyard shooting of January 17, 1989.  The limited disruption produced in tissue simulant by the rifle and bullets used in the Stockton, California, schoolyard shooting is entirely consistent with the autopsy reports on the five children who died of their wounds.  It is also entirely consistent with well-documented battlefield studies and with previous tissue-simulant studies from many laboratories.  It is inconsistent with many exaggerated accounts of assault-rifle wounding effects described by the media in the aftermath of this incident.  This information should be documented for the historical record.  However, the critical reason for correcting the misconceptions produced by media reaction to this incident is to prevent inappropriate gunshot-wound treatment.",20
"Cell injury associated calcium oxalate crystalluria.  Renal tubular cell damage, resulting in membranuria, was induced by the administration of subcutaneous gentamicin to male Sprague-Dawley rats.  One group of rats received gentamicin only, while a second group was given gentamicin plus ethylene glycol in drinking water at a concentration which increased urine oxalate but alone did not cause calcium oxalate crystalluria.  Crystalluria occurred early in the combined treatment groups and persisted for the duration of the experiment.  Crystalluria was not present in animals receiving gentamicin or ethylene glycol only.  These results suggest that cellular fragments can serve as heterogeneous foci for the nucleation of calcium oxalate crystals.",11
"Balloon expandable stent implantation in stenotic right heart valved conduits.  Although valved conduits have been used successfully in severe forms of right ventricular-pulmonary artery discontinuity, progressive valved conduit stenosis is an important clinical problem.  To determine the feasibility of reducing right heart valved conduit stenosis with a balloon expandable stent, a baboon model was used, in which the pulmonary artery was ligated and a right ventricular to pulmonary artery 14 mm bioprosthetic Dacron valved conduit implanted.  In five baboons, at an average of 40 months after valved conduit implantation, fibrointimal stenosis at the valve site resulted in narrowing and a mean transconduit pressure gradient of 49 mm Hg (range 33 to 65).  A tubular slotted steel stent (1.2 cm long) was deployed within the valved conduit after inflation of an 8 to 15 mm diameter balloon catheter that was introduced through the femoral vein.  A stent was delivered to all valved conduits; however, in two baboons, balloon undersizing resulted in stent dislodgment.  In the remaining three baboons, the transconduit gradient was reduced by 59% (49 to 20 mm Hg) and right ventricular systolic pressure decreased acutely by 35% (77 to 50 mm Hg).  It is concluded that stent deployment is feasible in right ventricular to pulmonary artery stenotic valved conduits and may result in significant hemodynamic improvement.  However, successful stent delivery is critically dependent on the proper selection of stent length and balloon diameter.",22
"Surgical treatment of aneurysm or dissection involving the ascending aorta and aortic arch, utilizing circulatory arrest and retrograde cerebral perfusion.  Recently we replaced the ascending aorta and aortic arch in 8 patients with aneurysm or dissection, using profound hypothermic circulatory arrest with retrograde cerebral perfusion.  There were no operative deaths.  Open aortic anastomosis facilitated repair of the aortic arch without clamping the arch tributaries, and embolism due to particulate debris from clamping of the arch vessels was eliminated.  Retrograde cerebral perfusion during profound hypothermic circulatory arrest is a simplified technique that may protect the brain.  This method offers advantages over previously described methods, particularly in obviating dissection of the arch tributaries and the clamping thereof, and in protecting the central nervous system.",13
"Pathogenesis of ceftriaxone-associated biliary sludge. In vitro studies of calcium-ceftriaxone binding and solubility.  Ceftriaxone, a semisynthetic third-generation cephalosporin, has recently been associated with biliary sludge formation.  Analysis of the biliary concretions induced by this agent shows a calcium salt of ceftriaxone.  The present in vitro studies were undertaken to provide insight into the pathogenesis of ceftriaxone-associated biliary sludge formation by evaluating possible interactions that may exist between calcium, bile salts, and ceftriaxone.  Ceftriaxone possessed high calcium-binding affinity.  The formation constant for the calcium ceftriaxone salt at 37 degrees C was about 157.3 L/mol; stoichiometry of the salt was 1:1, i.e., calcium ceftriaxone.  The calcium-binding property of ceftriaxone was observed to be additive to that of taurocholate in mixed taurocholate-ceftriaxone solutions.  Although the solubility product constant for calcium ceftriaxone was only 1.62 x 10(-6) mol/L2, marked metastability was observed; neither visible nor microscopic precipitates developed until the [Ca2+] x [ceftriaxone] ion product exceeded the solubility product constant by a factor of 10.4.  Metastability of the calcium ceftriaxone salt was also observed in human gallbladder bile in vitro.  Estimates of human biliary calcium ceftriaxone solubility in vivo were than calculated from previously-reported values for biliary [Ca2+], [ceftriaxone], and from the solubility product constant as defined in this study.  Calculated saturation indices for calcium-ceftriaxone in human bile generally increased (corresponding to a decrease in solubility) with increasing ceftriaxone dose.  At doses less than or equal to 1 g, saturation index was well within the metastable range of this calcium-salt.  However, at doses greater than or equal to 2 g, the saturation index surpassed the metastable limit.  Under these conditions, precipitation of ceftriaxone could occur.  It was concluded that the development of ceftriaxone-induced biliary sludge is a solubility problem that occurs in patients receiving high-dose treatment (greater than or equal to 2 g).  This study proposes that the risk of developing ceftriaxone-associated biliary ""pseudolithiasis"" increases with increasing ceftriaxone dose and in patients with impaired gallbladder emptying.",5
"Prospective evaluation of a protocol for induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia in patients referred to a tertiary centre.  All eight stages of a stimulation protocol that used one then two extrastimuli from the right ventricular apex in sinus rhythm and three ventricular drive rates (100, 120, and 140 beats/min) were performed in 24 patients with recurrent spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia despite drug treatment.  Twenty two of the patients had sustained a previous myocardial infarct and 18 were on long term treatment with amiodarone.  Sustained (greater than 30 s) ventricular tachycardia was induced in all patients.  Two extrastimuli were significantly more likely to induce sustained ventricular tachycardia than one extrastimulus, both overall and individually for the three ventricular drive rates.  A ventricular drive rate of 140 beats/min was significantly more likely to induce ventricular tachycardia than ventricular drive rates of 100 and 120 beats/min which were significantly more effective than sinus rhythm.  A ventricular drive rate of 140 beats/min with one or two extrastimuli induced ventricular tachycardia in 23/24 (95%) of the patients in this study.  The full eight stage protocol was progressive separately for both extrastimuli and ventricular drive rate but the last two stages (ventricular drive rate of 140 beats/min with one or two extrastimuli) were as effective as the entire protocol in inducing ventricular tachycardia.",13
"Home monitoring of gonadotropin ovulation induction using the Ovarian Monitor.  The safe use of gonadotropins relies on close hormonal and/or ultrasound monitoring to assess the response to treatment, requiring multiple hospital visits.  Home monitoring with the Ovarian Monitor (St.  Michael Research Foundation, Macleod, Victoria, Australia) minimizes hospital visits and overcomes many of the logistic difficulties associated with gonadotropin use.  It utilizes a system of homogenous enzyme immunoassay using lysozyme conjugates to measure quantitatively either urinary estrone-3 or pregnanediol-3-glucuronide.  Results obtained by 24 patients in 57 cycles using the Ovarian Monitor at home correlate closely with results obtained in the laboratory (estrone-3-glucuronide r = 0.955; pregnanediol-3-glucuronide r = 0.958).  Cycle outcomes (ovulation, 74%/cycle; clinical pregnancy, 30%/cycle; multiple pregnancy, 13%/pregnancy; hyperstimulation, 11%/cycle) are no different from those achieved in laboratory-monitored patients.  Home monitoring can be as safe and effective as laboratory monitoring, offers significant social benefits, and improves access to this form of therapy.",12
"Natural and modified history of complete atrioventricular septal defect--a 17 year study.  We reviewed 103 cases of isolated complete atrioventricular septal defect.  These cases represented 4.4% of the cases of congenital heart disease diagnosed in our hospital by catheterisation and angiography during 1971-88.  Most children (n = 76) had Down's syndrome.  Banding of the pulmonary artery was performed in seven cases and complete repair in 67 cases.  In the period 1971-82 the complete correction was performed at a mean age of 23 months with a surgical mortality of 88.8%.  In the period 1983-8 the mean age at complete correction was 13 months, the mortality 43.2%, and the five year actuarial survival was 46.8%.  The 22 patients that survived after complete correction were in functional classes I and II of the New York Heart Association classification.  After a mean follow up of 10 years only eight (36%) of the 22 who were followed up and treated medically survived; all had developed pulmonary vascular obstructive disease and were in functional classes III or IV.  Our findings stress the importance of early complete surgical repair.",15
Is preliminary binephrectomy necessary in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease undergoing renal transplantation?  Patients with end-stage chronic renal failure due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease who underwent renal transplantation with or without preliminary binephrectomy were retrospectively studied to determine the effect of binephrectomy on outcome.  Nineteen patients were identified.  Thirteen patients had no surgery prior to transplantation and six underwent preliminary binephrectomy.  One patient died as a result of the nephrectomy.  Twenty-one renal allografts were performed on 18 patients of whom seven have died of sepsis; 10 have functioning grafts and one has returned to dialysis.  Patients not undergoing preliminary binephrectomy had a statistically significant (p less than 0.05) increase in mortality and morbidity due to septic complications related to polycystic kidney disease.  Indications for bilateral nephrectomy should be reconsidered.,11
"Embryonic stem cell virus, a recombinant murine retrovirus with expression in embryonic stem cells.  The expression of Moloney murine leukemia virus and vectors derived from it is restricted in undifferentiated mouse embryonal carcinoma and embryonal stem (ES) cells.  We have developed a retroviral vector, the murine embryonic stem cell virus (MESV), that is active in embryonal carcinoma and ES cells.  MESV was derived from a retroviral mutant [PCC4-cell-passaged myeloproliferative sarcoma virus (PCMV)] expressed in embryonal carcinoma cells but not in ES cells.  The enhancer region of PCMV was shown to be functional in both cell types, but sequences within the 5' untranslated region of PCMV were found to restrict viral expression in ES cells.  Replacement of this region by related sequences obtained from the dl-587rev retrovirus results in MESV, a modified PCMV virus that confers G418 resistance to fibroblasts and ES cells with similar efficiencies.  Expression of MESV in ES cells is mediated by transcriptional regulatory elements within the 5' long terminal repeat of the viral genome.",3
"Laryngeal framework reconstruction with miniplates.  Defects of the laryngeal framework after trauma, cancer, and thyroplasty have been reconstructed with mini-reconstruction plates.  Six patients had miniplates used to repair the thyroid cartilage defect after type I thyroplasty to prevent lateralization of the Silastic implant; three patients had miniplates used after hemilaryngectomy to bridge the thyroid cartilage remnants, resulting in better deglutition after hemilaryngectomy; and three patients had miniplates used to repair laryngeal fractures.  The plates were tolerated well by the patients; there were no major complications.  Rigid fixation using miniplates for laryngeal reconstruction has unique advantages over the use of wires.  It offers the advantages of rigid and immediate stabilization with the ability to bridge large defects.  It can be an alternative to existing techniques of laryngeal reconstruction.",22
"Serous retinal detachment following glaucoma filtering surgery.  We report the occurrence of serous retinal detachment in association with choroidal effusion and hypotony in six eyes that had undergone glaucoma filtering surgery.  Hypotony with choroidal effusion was documented in five patients before the onset of serous retinal detachment.  While one patient underwent vitrectomy, treatment was conservative in the other patients.  Serous retinal detachment and choroidal effusions resolved spontaneously as the intraocular pressure normalized.  Although one patient regained preoperative visual acuity, all other patients lost at least one line of Snellen acuity.",10
"Carotid endarterectomy: a ten-year analysis of outcome and cost of treatment.  Between 1978 and 1988, 215 patients with an average age of 67 years, underwent 246 carotid endarterectomies.  Two hundred ten (85.4%) patients were symptomatic, and 36 (14.6%) were asymptomatic.  Six patients (2.4%) had a postoperative stroke, and all had immediate reoperation.  One of these patients died (30 day mortality rate, 0.4% for the series), and two (0.8%) recovered completely, whereas three (1.2%) had a mild permanent neurologic deficit.  Two patients (0.8%) had nonfatal myocardial infarction.  Mean follow-up of 42.2 months (range, 1 to 126 months) was achieved.  At 5 and 8 years actuarial survival rates of 82% and 66% and stroke-free survival rates of 67% and 37% were observed.  Actuarial stroke free rates of 90% at 5 and 8 years were noted.  By introducing and observing guidelines that required preoperative study of most clearly defined classes of patients before admission for surgical treatment, the average length of stay for carotid endarterectomy was lowered from 9.5 days in the first 5 years of the study to 5.8 days in the second 5 years (p = 0.001).  Average hospital charges, expressed in constant dollars, decreased from $3113 in the first 5 years to $2620 in the second 5 years (p = 0.02) despite an 88% inflationary increase in medical consumer price index.  This experience shows that the length of hospitalization of patients with carotid endarterectomy can be reduced and the cost of admission lowered without untoward effect on perioperative morbidity and mortality rates.",13
"Immunosuppressive effects of clonidine on the induction of contact sensitization in the balb/c mouse.  The clonidine transdermal therapeutic system (clonidine-TTS) has been associated with a significant incidence of allergic contact sensitization.  This incidence was not predicted by premarket skin sensitization testing in animals or humans.  One possible explanation lies in recent findings in guinea pigs that clonidine exposure could inhibit the elicitation of skin reactions to unrelated strong contact sensitizers.  However, these studies also showed that clonidine pretreatment did not appear to affect the induction of contact sensitization.  On this basis, we sought to specifically evaluate the induction phase of sensitization to clonidine as an alternative means of assessing its sensitization properties.  The method selected was the assay of in situ lymphocyte proliferation in lymph nodes draining the sites of clonidine exposure, a method recently promoted as an alternative means to assess contact allergenic potential.  Utilizing various induction application techniques and regimens, we were consistently unable to demonstrate clonidine's allergenic potential through such an assessment of lymphocyte proliferation.  We were also unable to demonstrate sensitization by in vivo ear swelling or in vitro lymphocyte blastogenesis assay techniques.  However, a subsequent assessment of the effect of clonidine exposure on the induction of sensitization to unrelated strong contact allergens demonstrated a consistent 40-70% inhibition of the proliferative response to the contact allergens oxazolone and trinitrochlorobenzene.  This was similar to the degree of suppression produced by the corticosteroids fluocinonide and hydrocortisone when they were tested at 80 and 10 times lower concentrations.  In addition, we observed a comparable inhibition of the ear swelling response to oxazolone.  These data extend our knowledge of the immunomodulatory effects of clonidine and offer additional mechanistic insights into the failure of short-term predictive patch-test methods to detect this chemical's potential to induce allergic contact sensitization.",16
"Mediastinal hibernoma, a rare tumor.  Hibernoma is an uncommon soft tissue tumor that is derived from the remnants of fetal brown fat.  Review of the world medical literature revealed 90 cases, 6 of which were intrathoracic.  We present the seventh case of intrathoracic hibernoma; in this case, the hibernoma was within the mediastinum without direct invasion of other structures.",3
"Tetanus immunization status and immunologic response to a booster in an emergency department geriatric population.  STUDY OBJECTIVES: Although effective procedures for the prevention of tetanus have long been available, serosurveys done since 1977 demonstrate that 49% to 66% of the elderly population lacks a protective antitoxin level (more than 0.01 IU/mL).  This study was undertaken to assess the tetanus immunization status of patients presenting to an emergency department and to evaluate their immunologic response to a tetanus booster.  SETTING: The study was conducted in a tertiary care ED.  TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: The patients enrolled were 65 or more years old and had breaks in their skin barriers.  DESIGN: At each patient's initial presentation, pertinent demographic data and tetanus immunization history were recorded.  The patient was then followed for 21 days.  INTERVENTIONS: Each patient's antitoxin titer was determined on a serum sample by ELISA, and, if required by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices criteria, a booster was administered at the first visit.  MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Serum antitoxin assays were repeated on days 7, 14, and 21 after the initial visit until seroconversion (titer more than 0.01 IU/mL).  Forty-four patients (55%) had protective levels at initial presentation, and in 36 (45%) the levels were not protective.  Age and sex were not predictive of protection.  Past military service and a definite history of three or more previous immunizations were good predictors of protection.  Of 34 patients who were followed serially for inadequate initial titers, only 19 (56%) seroconverted by day 14.  Patients who did not seroconvert were more likely to be older (P less than .05).  CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that a significant number of elderly patients lacked an initial protective level of tetanus antitoxin.  Of these, 44% failed to seroconvert within 14 days and carried a potential risk of developing tetanus.",0
"Cancer in the families of children with soft tissue sarcoma.  The cancer experience among 754 first-degree relatives (mothers, fathers, and siblings) of a population-based series of 177 children with soft tissue sarcoma is reported.  The current study represents an extension of our earlier work in which the authors found an excess of breast cancer in the mothers of 143 of these children.  There were 40 cancers among all first-degree relatives, compared with 24.82 expected (relative risk [RR] 1.61, P = 0.006).  There was no excess in fathers, but an excess of borderline significance was seen in mothers (RR 1.67, P = 0.0545), and a significant excess in siblings (RR 4.55, P = 0.0002), mainly due to carcinoma of the breast and pediatric tumors.  Results of a step forward Cox multivariate analysis identified three variables in the index child which were independently associated with high cancer risk in relatives, as follows: age younger than 24 months at diagnosis; histologic type, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma or other and unspecified soft tissue sarcoma; and male sex.  It was possible, therefore, to identify a subgroup of children whose relatives are at high risk of early onset cancer (RR in this group 10.14).  The pattern of cancers is consistent with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome.  The authors conclude that a marked proportion of childhood soft tissue sarcoma has a genetic basis.",3
"Cancer antigen 125, carcinoembryonic antigen, and carbohydrate determinant 19-9 in ovarian tumors.  The authors studied data of combination assays of tumor markers, because simultaneous elevation of different types of tumor markers in the serum was puzzling.  They interpreted such phenomena regarding cancer antigen 125, carcinoembryonic antigen, and carbohydrate determinant 19-9 in ovarian tumors.  The tissue expression of the antigens was compared with preoperative serum levels.  Several different factors were found to cause the simultaneous elevation of two or three of these markers in the serum.  Furthermore, even when the levels of some of the tumor markers were raised in the serum, the ovarian tumor did not always produce the marker by itself.  This study indicates that immunohistochemical identification of a marker in tumor tissue is prerequisite to the use of that marker in the serum to monitor disease status.",3
"Trends in lung cancer incidence and mortality--United States, 1980-1987 [published erratum appears in MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 1990 Dec 14;39(49):906]  Lung cancer is the most common fatal malignant neoplasm in the United States.  Based on current smoking patterns, the substantial public health burden of smoking-related lung cancer will continue during the next several decades.  This report describes trends in lung cancer incidence from 1980 through 1986 and lung cancer mortality from 1980 through 1987.",7
"Pharmacologic irreversible narrowing in chronic cerebrovasospasm in rabbits is associated with functional damage.  We studied isolated basilar artery segments from a rabbit model of chronic cerebrovasospasm.  Autologous blood placed around the basilar artery of rabbits killed 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 9 days later caused narrowing of the segments with a biphasic time course.  The first (immediate) phase was reversed by intra-arterial papaverine; the second phase exhibited an increasing component of narrowing that was papaverine-insensitive.  Based on the passive force/length curves, basilar artery segments became increasingly stiff over 9 days.  By contrast, the segments' contractility decreased.  Responses of the basilar artery segments were greater over the first few days, but then became less than that of saline-injected controls.  Contractions in response to norepinephrine and potassium were reduced.  Endothelium-based acetylcholine-induced vasodilation progressively diminished, as did the response to sympathetic nerve stimulation.  There was a negative correlation between artery wall stiffness and contractility.  The papaverine-insensitive component of angiographic narrowing correlated directly with loss of contractility and with artery wall stiffness.  These results are consistent with the conclusion that increased artery wall stiffness is a primary determining factor in the arterial narrowing of chronic cerebrovasospasm.",13
"Multiple keratoacanthomas treated with oral retinoids.  Multiple eruptive keratoacanthoma of Witten and Zak is a rare disorder characterized by numerous small, eruptive tumors and larger, more typical keratoacanthomas.  Affected patients have features of Grzybowski-type keratoacanthomas and Ferguson Smith type.  Two patients with multiple keratoacanthomas were treated with oral retinoids.  Both patients had hundreds of follicular papules on the trunk and extremities.  Less common lesions included nodules with central horn-filled craters more characteristic of classic keratoacanthomas.  Retinoid therapy resulted in regression of the larger, more typical keratoacanthomas in both patients.  The small follicular keratoacanthomas remained unaffected.  Thus oral retinoids are only partially beneficial for the treatment of the Grzybowski type or the Witten and Zak type of multiple eruptive keratoacanthomas.",16
"Hindbrain ischemia produced by bilateral vertebral artery occlusion and moderate hypotension in spontaneously hypertensive rats.  Hindbrain ischemia was induced by bilateral vertebral artery occlusion and moderate hypotension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs).  Mean arterial blood pressure was lowered to 80 mmHg in SHRs and to 50 mmHg in Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKYs) by a controlled hemorrhage, and then the vertebral artery was bilaterally occluded through alar foramina of the first cervical vertebra.  Following vertebral occlusion, blood flow of the cerebellum was significantly decreased to 9.4 +/- 2.0 mL/100g/min (+/- SEM) while flow of the cerebrum remained at 32.1 +/- 5.4 in SHRs.  In contrast, cerebellar blood flow in WKYs was preserved at 24.2 +/- 2.9 mL/100g/min.  Brain lactate, pyruvate, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) were determined in SHRs after sixty minutes of hypotension with or without vertebral occlusion.  Although infratentorial metabolites were actually unaltered in rats with hypotension alone, infratentorial lactate and lactate/pyruvate ratio significantly increased to 14.38 +/- 3.61 mmol/kg and 67.7 +/- 12.1, respectively, with a concomitant decrease in ATP in SHRs with hypotension and vertebral occlusion.  Bilateral vertebral artery occlusion, together with moderate hypotension, was shown to produce a marked reduction of cerebellar blood flow and to induce ischemic metabolic changes in the infratentorial brain in SHRs.",13
"Topical timolol and serum lipoproteins.  Oral timolol taken for the treatment of systemic hypertension has been shown to affect adversely serum lipoprotein levels.  In a 15-week study on 19 patients topical timolol therapy for raised intraocular pressure was found to have no significant adverse effect on serum lipoprotein levels.  This is reassuring in view of the large number of patients on this form of long term therapy, and selection of the type of beta blocker to use should not be influenced by lipid changes associated with the oral form of the drug.",10
"Early postoperative care of the cardiac transplantation patient: routine considerations and immunosuppressive therapy.  The authors have attempted to outline the current state of the art with respect to the early postoperative management of the cardiac transplant recipient with special attention to immunosuppressive therapies.  The commonly used agents, as well as the most successful combination regimens, have been described along with the current levels of expectation regarding rates of rejection and infection.  Much has been learned regarding the management of these problems.  Much remains to be learned to further decrease the incidence of postoperative infection and rejection and, equally if not more importantly, studies to investigate the etiology of transplant coronary artery disease need to be undertaken such that measures to delay or prevent its occurrence and/or arrest its progression can be instituted.",0
"Effect of somatostatin analogue (octreotide) on blood flow to endocrine tumors metastatic to the liver: angiographic evaluation.  The effect of an octapeptide analogue of somatostatin, octreotide, on tumor blood flow was evaluated with angiography in eight patients with hepatic endocrine tumors; one patient had primary intrahepatic gastrinoma, two patients had hepatic metastases from gastrinomas, two patients had VIPomas (vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-secreting tumor), and three patients had carcinoid tumors.  Octreotide caused a marked decrease in tumor blood flow in two patients with gastrinomas and two with VIPomas.  One patient could not be evaluated due to the lack of a tumor blush on a control angiogram.  In patients with carcinoid tumors, octreotide caused a slight reduction in blood flow through the tumors in two patients, while there was no change in one patient.  Octreotide markedly decreased gastrin and gastric acid secretion in two of three patients with gastrinomas, lowered VIP and stopped the diarrhea in patients with VIPomas, and controlled symptoms in two of three patients with carcinoid tumors.  The vasoactive effect of octreotide on hepatic endocrine tumors may be a direct action on tumor blood supply or secondary to inhibition of the endocrine tumor cell secretion and consequent decreased blood flow.",3
"Whitnall's sling for poor function ptosis.  Severe unilateral ptosis with poor levator function has previously been treated with maximal levator muscle resection or bilateral or unilateral frontalis suspension.  One of us (R.L.A.) has developed a technique called ""Whitnall's sling,"" where only the levator aponeurosis is resected, preserving Whitnall's ligament and its attachments.  Whitnall's ligament and the underlying resected levator muscle are sutured to the superior portion of the tarsal plate.  This surgery preserves levator muscle, Muller's muscle, and Whitnall's ligament without altering the structures that produce the three-layer tear film.  In 69 eyelids operated on between July 1976 and July 1986, in which a minimum of 1 year of follow-up by one of use was obtained, results have been satisfactory and directly related to levator function.  We believe this technique to be anatomically and physiologically superior to ""maximal levator resection"" with similar long-term results.  More recent results have shown that the addition of a 5-mm superior tarsectomy provides an additional elevation of 1 to 1.5 mm.  Whitnall's sling is best suited for cases where the opposite fissure height is 9 mm or less and levator function of the ptotic eyelid is 3 to 5 mm.",10
"Systemic amiloride inhibits experimentally induced neovascularization.  Amiloride is an inhibitor of urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and might therefore have an inhibitory effect on neovascularization.  Neovascularization was induced in rabbit corneas via local implantation of prostaglandin E1 pellets prepared in a slow-release polymer.  Animals received daily intraperitoneal injections of 30 mg of amiloride, or an equivalent volume of saline solution for 5 days; both were well tolerated without severe untoward effect.  Neovascular response, as documented by corneal photographs, was evaluated after 5 days of injections.  The area of induced corneal neovascularization was decreased by 55% in animals receiving amiloride when compared with controls.  Thus, amiloride and similar compounds may prove useful in the study and management of neovascularization.",21
"Stereotactic biopsy of an active multiple sclerosis lesion. Immunocytochemical analysis and neuropathologic correlation with magnetic resonance imaging.  Stereotactic biopsy of an active multiple sclerosis lesion in a 23-year-old patient with unilateral symptoms and an isolated high-signal-intensity magnetic resonance abnormality yielded 10 serial tissue cores (1.0 x 0.5 cm) spanning 40 mm within and around the lesion.  We performed semiquantitative analysis of lymphocyte phenotype, using antisera to CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD22 molecules, in 11 separate perivascular cuffs in three tissue sections from the lesion edge.  Total cells in the cuffs varied from 10 to 100; ratios of CD4+/CD8+ cells in individual cuffs varied from 1.3 to 4.7.  Although intense parenchymal infiltrates bordered the least cellular cuffs, parenchymal and perivascular cell phenotypes were indistinguishable, arguing against selective trafficking of lymphocytes into tissue.  Individual microfoci of cells displaying CD45RA, CD25, and TQ1 antigens were present.  The remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity of T lymphocytes in the multiple sclerosis lesion border is consistent with exposure in situ to a diversity of differentiating stimuli.  Histologic demyelination correlated very closely with the signal-intensity abnormality observed on magnetic resonance imaging.  These studies provide unusual insight into the histologic and immunocytochemical morphologic appearance of the active multiple sclerosis plaque.",19
"Histopathologic spectrum of clinically atypical melanocytic nevi. II. Studies of nonfamilial melanoma [published erratum appears in Arch Dermatol 1990 Dec;126(12):1616]  We studied the clinically most atypical pigmented lesion removed from each of 142 patients with newly diagnosed sporadic melanoma.  The specimens were categorized as to the type of nevus, ie, junctional or compound, presence of congenital features, and degree of nuclear atypicality--presence of nuclear enlargement, nuclear pleomorphism, hyperchromatism, and prominent nucleoli--of intraepidermal nevomelanocytes.  The frequency of nuclear abnormality was graded as 1 (rare cells), 2 (10% to 50% of cells), or 3 (greater than 50% of cells) for each nuclear parameter.  Among all lesions, 42 (29.6%) were junctional nevi, 74 (52.1%) were compound nevi, and 14 (9.9%) were dermal nevi.  Eighteen percent of the total were either dysplastic nevi (23 cases) or malignant melanoma in situ (three cases).  Fourteen nevi (9.9%) had congenital features.  There were 12 junctional and 39 compound nevi and one dermal nevus that exhibited nuclear abnormality, but only four junctional nevi compared with 19 compound nevi had sufficient atypia for a designation of dysplastic nevus.  Only two nevi with congenital features demonstrated any nuclear abnormality, and these were clearly nondysplastic.  Thus, among nevi surgically removed as the clinically most atypical lesion in this study, compound nevi were much more likely to demonstrate nuclear atypia (and dysplasia) than were other nevi, ie, junctional or dermal nevi, or nevi with congenital features.",3
"Transrectal ultrasonography for the early detection and staging of prostate cancer.  Relatively recent changes and improvements in equipment have vastly increased image resolution for transrectal ultrasonography of the prostate.  The expanded use of transrectal ultrasonography has greatly furthered knowledge of prostate zonal anatomy and permitted clinical evaluation of internal prostate architecture.  The technique is operator dependent, as the quality of the results is related directly to that person's knowledge and experience.  The significant majority of prostate cancers originate from the peripheral zone.  Palpable stage B nodules characteristically have a hypoechoic appearance.  There is disagreement about the tumor characteristics that cause hypoechogenicity, but large tumors may obscure the normal prostate anatomy and appear isoechoic because of the lack of contrast with surrounding prostate tissue.  The transition zone of the prostate is the origin of benign prostatic hyperplasia and almost 20 per cent of prostate cancers.  These tumors probably correspond to most stage A lesions.  Transrectal ultrasonography is less accurate in identifying transition zone tumors because of the mixed echogenicity of the transition zone, interference from prostatic calculi or calcified corpora amylacea, and poorer image resolution in this area.  Studies evaluating the use of transrectal ultrasonography for early detection of prostate cancer generally have shown a twofold increase in the detection rate compared with digital rectal examination.  However, the decreased morbidity and expense of transrectal prostate biopsy using an automatic gun device have increased the frequency of biopsy in ultrasound-examined patients compared with those historically evaluated by digital rectal examination.  The increased detection rate may in part be a function of the increased use of biopsies, independent of other factors.  Transrectal ultrasonography rarely detects cancer in patient with normal digital rectal examination and a normal serum prostate-specific antigen level.  Transrectal ultrasonography may be capable of identifying early capsular penetration or seminal vesicle invasion in some patients with known prostate cancer.  However, its superiority to digital rectal examination for this purpose has not been demonstrated unequivocally.  Ultrasonography does allow directed biopsies of the seminal vesicles or other suspect areas, and this may be helpful in staging the disease.  The use of transrectal ultrasonography in prostate cancer has evolved rapidly, and changes in technology antiquate reports within a few years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).",11
"Basic evaluation of female urinary incontinence.  Urinary incontinence is a common disorder that is frequently underreported because of its social implications.  Although several types of urinary incontinence are recognized, they can be generally classified as failure of the bladder to store or failure of the urethral mechanism.  A systematic approach for the evaluation of incontinence that includes history, physical examination, basic laboratory tests, and often urodynamic evaluation, offers the most comprehensive assessment of the etiology of incontinence.",11
"Rett syndrome: findings suggesting axonopathy and mitochondrial abnormalities.  We report the histopathologic findings of 3 sural nerve biopsies and 1 muscle biopsy from 3 patients with Rett syndrome.  The 3 sural nerve biopsies demonstrated a few ultrastructural abnormalities, including the presence of many Pi-granules and mitochondrial changes in the cytoplasm of Schwann cells, occasional bands of Bungner and onion-bulb formations, and mitochondrial alterations in myelinated axons.  Morphometric analysis disclosed reduction in the number of large myelinated fibers with normal densities in comparison to those of an age-matched normal control.  Light microscopic examination of the biopsied muscle from a 6-year-old patient with Rett syndrome revealed the existence of many small, dark, angulated fibers with NADH-TR staining.  Ultrastructural investigation of the muscle confirmed the presence of the dumbbell-shaped mitochondria.  Peripheral nerve involvement and the possibility of mitochondrial abnormalities in Rett syndrome were suggested by the results.",9
"The Van Nes tibial rotationplasty. A functionally viable reconstructive procedure in children who have a tumor of the distal end of the femur.  Twelve patients who had a malignant tumor of the distal end of the femur were treated with a Van Nes tibial rotationplasty.  The survival rates were comparable with those for above-the-knee amputees and patients who had an endoprosthetic replacement.  The results of functional testing showed that these patients performed as well as those who had endoprosthetic replacement and better than those who had above-the-knee amputation.  Rotationplasty is therefore a favorable alternative to amputation or endoprosthetic replacement, either as a primary or as a salvage procedure.",3
"Maternal mortality in the United States, 1979-1986.  To understand better the epidemiology and to describe the causes of maternal death, we reviewed all identified maternal deaths in the United States and Puerto Rico for 1979-1986.  The overall maternal mortality ratio for the period was 9.1 deaths per 100,000 live births.  The ratios increased with age and were higher among women of black and other minority races than among white women for all age groups.  The causes of death varied for different outcomes of pregnancy; pulmonary embolism was the leading cause of death after a live birth.  Unmarried women had a higher risk of death than married women.  The risk of death increased with increasing live-birth order, except for primiparas.  In order to develop strategies to reduce the risk of maternal death in the United States, future studies should include expanded information about each death, which will allow better understanding of factors associated with maternal mortality.",12
"Conjugal temporal arteritis.  We report the simultaneous occurrence of biopsy-proven temporal arteritis in husband and wife.  Serologic and viral studies were negative, including viral culture of the wife's temporal artery.  The concurrent incidence of giant cell arteritis in a married couple would suggest a common exogenous exposure.",13
"Short-term tamoxifen plus chemotherapy: superior results in node-positive breast cancer.  Three hundred eleven patients with node-positive breast cancer were randomized to one of three adjuvant treatments: cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil; all of the above with tamoxifen citrate; or all of the above with tamoxifen and bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination.  Local therapy for all patients was a modified radical mastectomy.  Estrogen receptors were measured on all primary tumors.  Patients were stratified by the number of positive nodes (one to three nodes and more than three nodes) and estrogen-receptor value (less than 3 femtomole/mg and greater than or equal to 3 femtomole/mg).  Follow-up is available, with a mean of 9.1 and maximum of 14.2 years.  In this study the efficacy of short-term tamoxifen is apparent over that of chemoimmunotherapy alone and continues to be significant with prolonged follow-up.  The addition of tamoxifen to chemoimmunotherapy significantly prolonged disease-free survival among patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors who were postmenopausal, who had larger tumors (greater than 3 cm), or who had more extensive axillary node involvement (more than three nodes).  Tamoxifen improved overall survival for patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors larger than 3 cm.  The addition of bacillus Calmette-Guerin Cytoxan, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, and tamoxifen did not significantly alter disease-free or overall survival.",3
"Alpha 1-antitrypsin excretion in stool in normal subjects and in patients with gastrointestinal disorders.  Fecal clearance of plasma alpha 1-antitrypsin is used as a measure of protein leakage into the intestinal tract.  In this study, the alpha 1-antitrypsin concentration in stool and the plasma clearance of alpha 1-antitrypsin in normal subjects and in a consecutive series of patients with chronic diarrhea, malabsorption, or unexplained hypoalbuminemia was determined.  The normal subjects were studied in their usual state and also when they had diarrhea secondary to ingestion of lactulose, sorbitol, sodium sulfate, or phenolphthalein.  The study first concluded that induced diarrhea can cause an increase in alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance; if this is not considered in establishing normal values, there may be an overdiagnosis of excess protein leakage in patients with diarrhea.  Second, there is a highly significant statistical correlation (P less than 0.001) between alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and serum albumin concentration.  On average, the serum albumin falls below 3.0 g/dL (30 g/L) when the alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance exceeds 180 mL/day, a value that is about threefold higher than the upper limit of normal.  Third, three of nine patients with microscopic/collagenous colitis had elevated clearance of alpha 1-antitrypsin; by contrast, abnormal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance was not found in 23 patients with idiopathic secretory diarrhea.  Fourth, fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin concentration is not a reliable index of abnormal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance.",5
"Diagnostic use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibited renal scintigraphy in the identification of selective renal artery stenosis in the presence of multiple renal arteries: a case report.  In patients with renovascular hypertension, it is unknown whether the angiotensin converting enzyme-(ACE) inhibited renal scan will identify stenosis of a segmental branch of a single renal artery or of an accessory artery where multiple renal arteries are present.  Since multiple renal arteries may be present in approximately 25% of all individuals, it will be important to establish whether the ACE-inhibited renal scan is useful in this population.  We report a case of stenosis involving a renal artery in a patient with multiple renal arteries, successfully identified by ACE-inhibited renal scintigraphy.",11
"Double-blind comparison of topical lignocaine-prilocaine cream (EMLA) and lignocaine infiltration for arterial cannulation in adults.  In a double-blind, double-dummy study, the efficacy of topical 5% EMLA cream was compared with that of lignocaine infiltration in alleviating the pain of arterial cannulation.  Forty unpremedicated adults were allocated randomly to four groups to receive EMLA cream alone, EMLA and 0.9% saline infiltration, EMLA and 1% lignocaine infiltration or placebo cream and 1% lignocaine infiltration.  Following arterial cannulation, pain was assessed by the patient using a visual analogue score and by an independent observer using a four-category verbal rating score.  Significantly lower pain scores were observed in all patients receiving EMLA compared with those receiving placebo cream and lignocaine infiltration by both patient (P less than 0.01) and observer (P less than 0.001) assessments.  There were no significant differences between the three EMLA groups.",9
"Comparison of right ventricular and biventricular circulatory support in a porcine model of right heart failure.  The effects of right ventricular (RVAD) and biventricular assist devices (BVAD) in an acute porcine model of right heart ischemic failure produced by occluding the right coronary artery for 2 min (RCAO) were compared.  Right and left ventricular pressures were measured with Millar transducers and respective septal-to-free wall dimensions (RVSFWD, LVSFWD) with ultrasonic crystals.  RCAO alone resulted in significant right heart failure, marked by a 36 +/- 5% reduction in cardiac output (pulmonary artery flow) and a 54 +/- 16% reduction in RV stroke work.  Isolated RVAD significantly improved the hemodynamic conditions by restoring pulmonary blood flow and left heart filling to control levels.  RVAD also resulted in reduced RVSFWD to control levels and increased LVSFWD via a rightward septal shift due to right heart unloading.  Biventricular support resulted in the same hemodynamic improvement, but estimated LV peak systolic wall stress was reduced by 65 +/- 15% compared with control, due to concomitant LV unloading and reductions in LVSFWD.  Therefore, either right or biventricular devices are effective in treating RV failure.  The advantage of biventricular support is that the left ventricle is also unloaded, thus allowing improved circulatory support with minimal LV wall stress.",13
"Technical aspects of biliary extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy.  Radiologic imaging procedures play a major role in the evaluation of the potential patient for biliary extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, both during the procedure and in follow-up evaluation.  The treating physician must have a thorough knowledge of ultrasonography techniques.  Lithotripsy requires continual monitoring and frequent reassessment to optimize targeting and fragmentation of the gallstones while maintaining patient comfort.",5
"Lidocaine local anesthesia for arthroscopic knee surgery.  Forty-five patients were evaluated during knee arthroscopy performed using local anesthesia produced by lidocaine with epinephrine to determine the dose-response relationship for operative analgesia.  Serum lidocaine concentrations were also measured.  Patients were randomized prospectively to receive 20 mL of 0.5%, 1.0%, or 1.5% lidocaine with epinephrine intraarticularly.  Intraoperative discomfort was measured by verbal response on an 11-point linear pain scale.  Pain scores were significantly higher in patients receiving 0.5% lidocaine during the first 45 min of surgery (P = 0.03).  After 45 min, pain scores continued to be higher in the 0.5% lidocaine group than in the 1.0% or 1.5% groups, but the differences were not statistically significant.  Ninety-four percent of patients in the 1.5% lidocaine group were willing to repeat this anesthetic technique for surgery compared with 83% of those in the 1.0% lidocaine group and 75% of those in the 0.5% lidocaine group (P greater than 0.05).  The duration of postoperative analgesia was similar in all groups.  Serum lidocaine concentrations before and 15, 30, 60, and 120 min after instillation of lidocaine were highest in the 1.5% lidocaine group with a peak concentration of 278 ng/mL.  No patient had symptoms of lidocaine toxicity.  We recommend that lidocaine concentrations of 1.0% or 1.5% be used when 20 mL is instilled intraarticularly for knee arthroscopy based on patient comfort and absence of lidocaine toxicity.",22
"Allogeneic marrow transplantation in patients with acute myeloid leukemia in first remission: a randomized trial of two irradiation regimens   A randomized trial of 12.0 Gy versus 15.75 Gy of total body irradiation (TBI) was performed in patients with acute myeloid leukemia undergoing allogeneic marrow transplantation while in first complete remission.  All patients received 120 mg/kg cyclophosphamide followed by TBI and marrow from HLA-identical siblings.  Cyclosporine and methotrexate were used for prophylaxis against acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).  Thirty-four patients received 2.0-Gy fractions of irradiation daily for 6 days and 37 received 2.25-Gy fractions daily for 7 days.  The 3-year actuarial probabilities for relapse-free survival were 0.58 for the patients who received 12.0 Gy and 0.59 for those who received 15.75 Gy.  The 3-year probabilities of relapse were 0.35 for the 12.0 Gy group and 0.12 for the 15.75 Gy group (P = .06).  The 3-year probabilities of transplant-related mortality were 0.12 and 0.32, respectively (P = .04).  The probability of moderate to severe acute GVHD was 0.21 for the 12.0 Gy group and 0.48 for the 15.75 Gy group (P = .02).  Patients exposed to the higher irradiation dose received less immunoprophylaxis against, and had a higher incidence of, acute GVHD.  The increased dose of TBI significantly reduced the probability of relapse but did not improve survival because of increased mortality from causes other than relapse.",19
"Excess deaths from nine chronic diseases in the United States, 1986   To assess excess mortality from chronic disease in the United States, state age-adjusted combined mortality rates for nine chronic diseases in 1986 were compared with three ""minimum"" rates--two calculated from rates actually achieved in states and a third estimated as the mortality remaining after elimination of one risk factor for each disease.  Hawaii had the lowest mortality rate of combined diseases (305/100,000); state excesses ranged from 0% to 37%.  The sum of lowest disease-specific rates in any state was 284 per 100,000, indicating excesses of between 7% and 41%.  A minimum mortality rate of 224 per 100,000 was estimated to result from elimination of one risk factor for each of the nine diseases, indicating state excesses from 26% to 54%, or 524,000 US deaths.  Reduction of US mortality from the nine diseases to the risk factor--eliminated rate is estimated to be associated with an increased life expectancy at birth of 4 years.",22
"Defective dystrophin in Duchenne and Becker dystrophy myotubes in cell culture.  We examined normal and dystrophic human myotubes in cell culture for expression of dystrophin, the protein product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus.  Dystrophin levels in developing myotubes detected by Western blotting increased after 24 hours and reached maximum levels after 10 days in fusion medium.  We did not detect dystrophin in myotubes cultured from Duchenne myoblasts (7 cases).  Myotubes from a Becker muscular dystrophy patient's biopsy produced a lower molecular weight (approximately 408 kd) dystrophin, which was the same size in a whole muscle preparation from the same biopsy.  This 408-kd dystrophin was the expected size for this Becker patient whose DNA was deleted for exons 45-48 of the Duchenne gene.  This cell culture system will allow a detailed analysis of the effects of potential pharmacologic agents on steady-state dystrophin levels.",22
"Treatment of atelectasis of upper lung lobes. Selective bronchial suctioning with J-shaped catheter tip and guide mark.  We developed a technique for blind bronchial suction using a curved-tip catheter with a guide mark, for the treatment of atelectasis of the lower and middle lobes of the lung.  Suction of the upper lobe bronchi could not be performed because of the combination of the peculiar anatomy of the upper lobe bronchi with catheter design.  We treated successfully two cases of atelectasis of the right upper lobes using a Rusch Metras bronchography catheter with a guide mark which is not readily available.  Therefore we devised a J-shape tipped catheter with a guide mark.  We have successfully treated 13 episodes of atelectasis of the right upper lobe in 10 patients and one episode in the left upper lobe in one patient with this new catheter.",7
"Day care characteristics associated with Haemophilus influenzae disease. Haemophilus influenzae Study Group.  To identify characteristics of day care facilities associated with H.  influenzae disease, we compared 92 licensed facilities in which a case of H.  influenzae disease had occurred with randomly selected facilities at which no cases occurred.  Matched univariate analysis showed that personnel at facilities where H.  influenzae disease occurred were more likely than those at control facilities to use towels or handkerchiefs to wipe children's noses, admit children who were not toilet trained or had diarrhea (""liberal fecal policy""), had a narrower age range, were more likely than control facilities to be for-profit and less likely to use volunteers.  In a multivariate model that adjusted for age range, profit status and liberal fecal policy, towel or handkerchief use (OR 5.5, 95% CI: 1.1, 30) was the only variable independently associated with case facilities.  This is the first association of a specific day care practice with H.  influenzae disease.",0
"Laryngomalacia in children.  Two hundred three (68 percent) of 297 children with laryngomalacia had associated respiratory disorders by flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FFB).  Associated disorders included congenital respiratory anomalies, a variety of anatomic obstructions of the upper and lower airways, and aspiration disorders.  Mean age for isolated laryngomalacia (type 1) was 11.5 weeks (range, 5 weeks to 4 months) while children with laryngomalacia and associated respiratory disorders (type 2) had a mean age of 9.06 years (range, 6 weeks to 18 years).  We conclude the following: (1) complete evaluation of the pediatric airways (bronchoscopy) is recommended in every symptomatic child with diagnosis of laryngomalacia confirmed by laryngoscopy; (2) type 1 laryngomalacia was more common in early infancy while type 2 laryngomalacia was associated with older age; (3) although type 2 laryngomalacia is the most common endoscopic diagnosis in our experience, the majority of cases were associated with lower airway dysfunction.",22
"Overview of hemochromatosis.  Hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder that occurs with high prevalence in populations of European origin.  The gene that is abnormal in hemochromatosis is found on the short arm of chromosome 6 in close proximity (approximately 1 centimorgan) to HLA-A, but the product coded for by that gene is unknown.  The pathogenetic mechanism in hemochromatosis is that of continued, excessive absorption of dietary iron with loss of normal control mechanisms, leading to a gradual but vast expansion of storage iron as ferritin and especially as hemosiderin.  Through mechanisms that probably include peroxidation of lipid membranes, the excess iron injures hepatocytes, islet B cells, gonadotropes in the anterior pituitary, myocardium, synovial cells, and chondrocytes, and probably other cells and tissues as well.  Most patients with hemochromatosis remain undiagnosed throughout life.  Removal of the excess iron by phlebotomy will prevent all of the complications of hemochromatosis when begun early and will significantly improve survival in virtually all patients.  It is important, therefore, that the diagnosis of hemochromatosis be considered much more frequently in clinical medicine in order that this effective therapy be utilized.",17
"Morbidly obese patients' perceptions of social discrimination before and after surgery for obesity.  Morbidly obese patients' perceptions of obesity-related prejudice and discrimination were assessed before and 14 months after operation for obesity.  Preoperatively, the 57 consecutive patients perceived overwhelming prejudice and discrimination at work, within the family, and in public places.  After a weight loss of more than 45.5 kg (100 lb), these patients perceived little or no prejudice or discrimination.  We examine factors contributing to the change in patients' perceptions and comment upon patients' perceptions of the negative attitudes held by health professionals toward obese patients.",17
"Speculations on the immunopathogenesis of psoriasis: T-cell violation of a keratinocyte sphere of influence.  The thesis is advanced that the differences in antigen processing and presentation described for ""fresh"" and ""cultured"" Langerhans cells in vitro reflect similar differences between intraepidermal and intranodal Langerhans cells in vivo.  The functional properties of Langerhans cells are dependent upon the microenvironment in which they reside; thus, intraepidermal Langerhans cells are under the influence of cytokines secreted by keratinocytes, whereas intranodal Langerhans cells come under the influence of lymphokines from T lymphocytes.  It is speculated that a genetic lesion in psoriasis robs keratinocytes of their capacity to create an ""appropriate"" epidermal microenvironment.  As a consequence, intraepidermal Langerhans cells adopt the functional program of intranodal cells.  When ""uninvolved"" psoriatic skin receives a cutaneous challenge with antigen, Langerhans cells, by activating naive T cells in situ, unwittingly engender a microenvironment that is more appropriate to a lymph node.  This skin becomes ""involved"" as it gradually acquires features associated with lymph nodes (such as high endothelial venules).  And the derangement is further complicated by abnormalities of proliferation and differentiation among keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts as they respond to the inappropriate T-cell-derived lymphokines, giving rising to the typical, active psoriatic lesion.",16
"AIDS, minority patients, and doctors: what's the risk? Who's talking?  We asked 39 physicians providing primary care for a mostly minority patient population to respond to a questionnaire concerning their attitudes and behavior toward AIDS risk assessment and preventive counseling and to indicate their beliefs concerning patients' knowledge and behavior.  Most of the 36 physicians who responded (92%) agreed that physicians must educate their patients about AIDS.  They also reported that patients who engage in risk-taking behavior may not know much about AIDS transmission and prevention.  Despite these beliefs, these doctors reported that they gave advice to only 11% of their male patients and 14% of their female patients.  More than one third of physicians reported feeling uncomfortable talking about patients' sexual preferences and practices.  To identify patients at risk and to help prevent AIDS, methods must be found to make physicians more comfortable discussing sexual issues with their patients, especially their minority patients.",19
"Evaluation and management of patients with inhalation injury.  Inhalation injury, present in approximately one third of burned patients treated at burn centers, increases mortality by a maximum of 20% in relation to age and extent of burn.  The development of animal models of inhalation injury has made possible the identification of both the airway and vascular responses evoked by smoke inhalation.  Inflammatory occlusion of terminal bronchioles and necrosis of the endobronchial mucosa render the airway and pulmonary parenchyma susceptible to infection and the resulting pneumonitis further increases mortality.  Early diagnosis, best achieved by endoscopic bronchoscopy and 133xeon ventilation perfusion scan, permits timely application of high-frequency ventilation that appears to reduce the incidence of pneumonia and to decrease mortality.  Pharmacologic agents give promise of ameliorating the deleterious changes of the vasculature.  The recent advances in understanding inhalation injury have identified the research needed to further improve patient salvage.",20
"Sedoanalgesia in urology: a safe, cost-effective alternative to general anaesthesia. A review of 1020 cases.  Sedoanalgesia is a technique developed to provide safe and satisfactory operating conditions for a wide range of patients independent of age and overall level of fitness (although its use in children remains to be established).  It is suitable for both endoscopic and open procedures, day-cases and in-patients.  When used in day-case surgery it significantly improves overall efficiency.  It is recognised that day-case surgery is an important and cost-effective element in surgical care.  With increasing restraints being imposed upon hospital finances, patient beds and staffing levels, any strategies designed to improve efficiency in this sphere of surgical activity are to be welcomed.  That 93% of patients prefer sedoanalgesia to conventional general anaesthesia attests to its high degree of acceptability.  The technique of sedoanalgesia, its applications and potential impact for urology are detailed.",11
"Childhood stroke after minor neck trauma: case report.  Cerebral infarction after minor trauma to the neck has rarely been reported.  A case is presented of a child with trauma to the vertebrobasilar artery resulting in stroke.  Computerized tomography scan and angiography results are presented.  Despite two subsequent, separate transient episodes of vertigo, the child had good functional recovery with complete restoration of language and cognitive function.  After 28 months, residual impairments identified were a mild right-sided ataxia and hemiparesis.",9
"Impact of mass treatment of onchocerciasis with ivermectin on the transmission of infection.  Onchocerciasis is a major blinding disease that, until recently, has been essentially untreatable.  Ivermectin is a safe and effective drug for the mass treatment of onchocerciasis and when used on an individual basis, it reduces the ability of the treated person to transmit Onchocerca volvulus infection.  In the present study, the effect of community-based ivermectin treatment on the degree of transmission within the community was assessed by determining the incidence of new infection in children.  Ivermectin was distributed annually on three occasions to the eligible members of a population of approximately 14,000 people living on a rubber plantation in a forest area endemic for onchocerciasis.  After 2 years, the prevalence of infection in 5-year-old children decreased by 21%.  The annual incidence in an uninfected cohort of children decreased by 35% and, after age-specific adjustment, the reduction in incidence in 7- to 12-year-old children was 45%.  Thus, community-based distribution of ivermectin led to a significant reduction in incidence of new infection.  These findings suggest that ivermectin can be important in reducing the transmission of onchocerciasis.",2
"Lack of association between medication use and the presence or absence of bacteriuria in elderly women.  This study was undertaken to determine if there is an association between medication use and the presence or absence of bacteriuria in elderly ambulatory women.  Of 198 women who participated in three urine culture surveys (every 6 months) during the 18-month study period, 66 (34.4%) had bacteriuria on at least one survey.  Both univariate and multivariate analyses for the demographics, age, place of residence, and medication use (by drug class) revealed that only place of residence had a significant association with the presence or absence of bacteriuria.  In this regard, bacteriuric subjects more commonly resided in the nursing home and less commonly lived in the apartment-house complex compared with nonbacteriuric subjects (P less than .05).  Therefore, this study demonstrates that in elderly ambulatory women, medication use does not appear to be associated with the presence or absence of bacteriuria.",0
"Urodynamic tests for female geriatric urinary incontinence.  Most urodynamic tests currently in use in the evaluation of female urinary incontinence have not been applied to a community-based sample to determine their specificity.  In this study of a random sample of noninstitutionalized elderly, 258 self-reported continent and 198 self-reported incontinent women sixty years and older, who participated in a household survey, underwent a clinic evaluation (history, physical examination, and urinalysis); of these 67 continent and 100 incontinent female respondents underwent urodynamic testing.  The uroflowmetry, cystometry, and supine static urethral pressure profilometry (UPP) findings did not differ significantly between continent and incontinent subjects (whether based on a self-report or a clinician's diagnosis of urinary continence status).  Standing static and dynamic UPP and lateral cystography showed significant differences between self-reported continent and incontinent respondents.  The provocative stress test significantly distinguishes continence from incontinence, and stress incontinence from other types.  The sensitivity of the provocative stress test was 39.5 percent, whereas its specificity is 98.5 percent.  Urodynamic testing including uroflow study, static UPP, and lateral cystography should not be used as a screening test but rather selectively as a confirmatory test, and to determine the therapeutic approach, and to assess the outcome of therapy.",11
"Familial occurrence of gastric cancer in the 2-year experience of a population-based registry.  The authors studied the familial occurrence of tumors in 154 individuals with gastric cancer by reviewing the clinical data and the genealogical tree of all patients registered in 1986 through 1987 in the Local Health Care District of Modena, Italy, for cancer of the stomach.  Crude and age-adjusted (world population) incidence rates of gastric cancer were 34.0 and 21.4 new cases/100,000/year, respectively, in men, and 24.5 and 10.9 in women, respectively.  Among first-degree relatives of the registered patients there were 30 cases of gastric carcinoma versus 15 cases in a control group matched for age and sex (Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio [M-H OR] 3.14, P less than 0.01).  This excess of gastric neoplasms was observed in siblings (17 versus 7, M-H OR 4.33, P less than 0.02) but not in parents (13 versus 8, not significant).  Besides gastric cancer, there was no significant excess of other type of tumors in case families.  The familial occurrence of gastric cancer tended to be more frequent in patients with ""diffuse"" carcinoma (52%) than in subjects with ""intestinal"" cancer (33%), although the difference was not statistically significant.  In conclusion, the current investigation suggests that a ""family history"" for gastric neoplasms is usually observed in approximately 10% to 15% of the registered cases.  As already described for other common malignancies, therefore, the familial occurrence of gastric carcinoma suggests the existence of a genetic susceptibility to cancer of the stomach, at least in a fraction of these patients.",3
"Human colorectal cancers display abnormal Fourier-transform infrared spectra.  Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was applied to the study of tissue sections of human colorectal cancer.  Pairs of tissue samples from colorectal cancer and histologically normal mucosa 5-10 cm away from the tumor were obtained from 11 patients who underwent partial colectomy.  All cancer specimens displayed abnormal spectra compared with the corresponding normal tissues.  These changes involved the phosphate and C-O stretching bands, the CH stretch region, and the pressure dependence of the CH2 bending and C = O stretching modes.  Our findings indicate that in colonic malignant tissue, there are changes in the degree of hydrogen-bonding of (i) oxygen atoms of the backbone of nucleic acids (increased); (ii) OH groups of serine, tyrosine, and threonine residues (any or all of them) of cell proteins (decreased); and (iii) the C = O groups of the acyl chains of membrane lipids (increased).  In addition, they indicate changes in the structure of proteins and membrane lipids (as judged by the changes in their ratio of methyl to methylene groups) and in the packing and the conformational structure of the methylene chains of membrane lipids.  The cell(s) of the malignant colon tissues responsible for these spectral abnormalities is unknown.  Cultured colon adenocarcinoma cell lines displayed similarly abnormal FT-IR spectra.  The diagnostic potential of the observed changes is discussed.",3
"The value of pulmonary artery and central venous monitoring in patients undergoing abdominal aortic reconstructive surgery: a comparative study of two selected, randomized groups.  One hundred two patients undergoing abdominal aortic reconstructive surgery were prospectively, randomly allocated to two groups, one of which was monitored with a central venous catheter and the other with a pulmonary artery catheter.  Patients with uncompensated cardiopulmonary or renal disease were excluded from the study.  General anesthesia was administered for the surgical procedure, and the patients were followed through hospital discharge.  No statistically significant differences occurred between the two groups with regard to morbidity (perioperative cardiac, pulmonary or renal sequelae), mortality rate, duration of intensive care, postoperative hospital stay, or cost of hospitalization.  The one statistically significant difference between groups was the professional fee charged for anesthetic care, which was higher for patients with pulmonary artery catheters than for those with central venous catheters.  In conclusion, we prospectively gathered data from most patients presented for abdominal aortic reconstructive surgery.  Our data seem to indicate that the choice of central venous catheter or pulmonary artery catheter monitoring makes little difference in outcome after abdominal aortic reconstructive surgery, and that for many patients pulmonary artery catheters are not necessary to give appropriate, adequate care.  Because of the size of the sample, however, declarations of epidemiologic significance would be unfounded.  Therefore large-scale, multicenter studies addressing such outcomes remain necessary.",13
"The other alcohols. Methanol, ethylene glycol, and isopropanol.  The alcoholic patient, in an attempt to maintain an altered mental status, may ingest ethanol substitutes containing methanol, ethylene glycol, or isopropanol.  The subsequent clinical presentation in the Emergency Department is highly variable and depends on the ethanol substitute ingested, the time since ingestion, and concomitant ethanol abuse.  This article describes the clinical features of intoxication by the ethanol substitutes.  Early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention may prevent irreversible sequelae.  The rationale for treatment interventions is discussed.",20
"Immunophenotypes in ""classical"" B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Correlation with normal cellular counterpart and clinical findings.  This study evaluates the expression of a series of membrane antigens, normally expressed by B-lymphocytes of the lymphocytic mantle and marginal zone, in 90 selected cases of ""classical"" (mouse red blood cell-receptor+, CD20+, CD5+, surface immunoglobulin +/-) B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) with the aim of contributing toward identifying the normal counterpart of B-CLL and any correlations between surface antigen pattern and certain clinical characteristics.  Clustered (CD23, 25, 39, 40, 27, 1c, w75) and unclustered (NuB1, 7F7, KiB3) monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) were tested.  Almost all cases showed high reactivity to CD23, 27, w75, 39, 40, and NuB1: expression of CD1c was very low and that of 7F7, KiB3, and CD25 was variable.  The reactivity of 7F7 and KiB3 was strictly correlated, and they correlated individually with CD25.  Results show that the most frequent B-CLL phenotype (CD19+, 5+, 23+, 27+, 39+, NuB1+, KiB3 +/-, 7F7 +/-, and CD25 +/-) corresponds to one or more cellular subsets in the mantle zone.  No correlation was found between MoAb expression, surface immunoglobulin (SIg) class or type, clinical stage, disease activity, or age at diagnosis.  The only difference (statistically borderline) was the expression of 7F7 and KiB3 (in young versus old patients).  This suggests that modulations in the expression of surface antigens do not affect the clinical behavior of the disease.",3
"Late luteal phase dysphoric disorder in young women.  The authors determined the prevalence of late luteal phase dysphoric disorder in 217 university women aged 17-29 years.  Unaware of the focus on premenstrual syndrome (PMS), the participants rated DSM-III-R symptoms of late luteal phase dysphoric disorder over 90 days.  Using a 30% or greater premenstrual change as an index of luteal variation, the authors found that 10 women (4.6%) met the symptom criteria during two menstrual cycles.  Compared to 25 young women seeking treatment for PMS who met the same diagnostic criteria, the 10 women from the university sample reported significantly less fatigue and impaired concentration and somewhat less severe depression and overall symptoms.",22
"Itraconazole in common dermatophyte infections of the skin: fixed treatment schedules.  Itraconazole is an effective medication against the most common dermatophytoses.  It has been shown to be more active than griseofulvin and ketoconazole.  Ease of use, affinity for keratinized tissues, lack of toxicity, continued activity after discontinuation, and the possibility of using fixed schedules are advantages of itraconazole.  The fixed schedules indicated by pharmacokinetics and clinical studies are one 100 mg capsule daily for 15 days in cases of tinea corporis and tinea cruris and the same dosage for 30 days in cases of tinea pedis and tinea manuum.  These fixed treatments have some limitations, and they are not recommended for treating tinea capitis and tinea unguium.  The drug is well tolerated.",0
"Multiple alterations in insulin responses to glucose in islets from 48-h glucose-infused nondiabetic rats.  To examine the biochemical mechanisms by which hyperglycemia produces insulin secretory abnormalities, we studied isolated islets from control rats and rats infused for 48 h with a 50% glucose solution.  To preserve the effects of in vivo hyperglycemia during in vitro handling for islet isolation, our standard isolation procedure utilized buffers containing 16.8 mM glucose.  Islets from infused rats released similar amounts of insulin in low or high glucose during first incubations at 37 degrees C (92.4 +/- 7.0 ng.10 islets-1.45 min-1 at 2.8 mM, 84.4 +/- 4.1 ng.10 islets-1.45 min-1 at 16.8 mM) in contrast with control (uninfused) islets (18.6 +/- 2.8 ng.10 islets-1.45 min-1 at 2.8 mM and 109.8 +/- 8.0 ng.10 islets-1.45 min-1 at 16.8 mM glucose) (P less than 0.01).  Secretion by islets of glucose-infused rats was lower during 60-min second incubations at 28 mM glucose than in first incubations of the same islets in low glucose (P less than 0.01).  This phenomenon is comparable to the paradoxical hypersecretion observed during the first 10-15 min of exposure of glucose-infused pancreas to low-glucose perfusions.  Paradoxical secretion in low glucose waned rapidly, so that during second incubations at 37 degrees C, little immunoreactive insulin release occurred at 2.8 mM glucose, despite the persistence of two additional lesions.  The glucose-insulin dose-response curves in second incubations showed a leftward shift for glucose-infused islets, with two- to threefold higher secretion at 5.6-8.4 mM glucose than control islets.  This is termed sensitization to glucose.",19
"Immunocytochemical localization of progesterone receptors in endocrine cells of the human pancreas.  Progesterone receptors (PgR) have been immunocytochemically localized in the nuclei of several (40% to 75%) endocrine cells of the human pancreas and in a more variable number of neoplastic cells of 7 of 18 endocrine pancreatic tumors.  Conversely the exocrine epithelial cells of the pancreas did not exhibit any PgR immunoreactivity in normal as well as in different pathologic conditions, including pancreatic adenocarcinomas.  Estrogen receptors were not detected in any of the pancreatic samples investigated.  Double immunocytochemical experiments have documented that PgR immunoreactivity in normal Langerhans islets is a consistent feature of most (75%) glucagon-producing A cells, of approximately 5% to 20% of insulin-producing B cells, and of a variable percentage of pancreatic polypeptide (PP)-producing cells, ranging from 5% to 70%.  These figures were not affected by the sex, age, or underlying disease of the patients.  The reported findings corroborate previous clinical and experimental evidence indicating that sex steroid hormones may have some regulatory effects on the functional activity of the endocrine pancreas.",3
"A human XY female with a frame shift mutation in the candidate testis-determining gene SRY.  The primary decision about male or female sexual development of the human embryo depends on the presence of the Y chromosome, more specifically on a gene on the Y chromosome encoding a testis-determining factor, TDF.  The human sex-determining region has been delimited to a 35-kilobase interval near the Y pseudoautosomal boundary.  In this region there is a candidate gene for TDF, termed SRY, which is conserved and specific to the Y chromosome in all mammals tested.  The corresponding gene from the mouse Y chromosome is deleted in a line of XY female mutant mice, and is expressed at the expected stage during male gonadal development.  We have now identified a mutation in SRY in one out of 12 sex-inversed XY females with gonadal dysgenesis who do not lack large segments of the short arm of the Y chromosome.  The four-nucleotide deletion occurs in a sequence of SRY encoding a conserved DNA-binding motif and results in a frame shift presumably leading to a non-functional protein.  The mutation occurred de novo, because the father of the sporadic XY female that bears it has the normal sequence at the corresponding position.  These results provide strong evidence for SRY being TDF.",18
"Analysis of lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons for HIV DNA.  The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects and depletes or alters the function of cells involved in immune responsiveness.  While both T helper lymphocytes and monocyte/macrophages can be infected via cell-surface CD4 in vitro, previous studies showed that few blood cells express HIV RNA in vivo.  This study used DNA amplification to determine the levels of HIV DNA in purified lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils from HIV-infected asymptomatic individuals and persons with AIDS.  The average numbers of HIV DNA copies in lymphocytes from AIDS patients and asymptomatic individuals were similar (approximately 100-140 copies/150,000 cells).  However, when expressed on the basis of numbers of CD4+ T cells, AIDS patients' cells contained approximately 2.5 times more HIV DNA.  While HIV DNA was present in lymphocytes from all 27 subjects, little or no HIV DNA was observed in monocytes or neutrophils.  Only 1 asymptomatic person contained levels of HIV DNA in monocytes (125 proviral copies/150,000 cells) that were comparable to levels expressed in lymphocytes (160/150,000).  While expression of monocyte HIV DNA in this person was persistent over at least 8 months, it was not observed in neutrophils, suggesting that monocyte HIV DNA did not originate in myeloid precursors.  This study shows that in AIDS or asymptomatic HIV infection, lymphocytes are the predominant infected cell found in blood.",19
"A standard dose of radiation for ""microscopic disease"" is not appropriate.  Elective irradiation of sites of potential occult tumor spread is often part of a patient's radiation therapy program.  The required radiation dose (D) depends on the probability that occult disease exists (P(occ)), the number of sites at risk (A), the number of tumor clonogens present (Ni), their radiation sensitivity, and the desired control rate.  An exponential model of cell survival is used to quantify the importance of these factors.  Control Probability = [1 - Pocc x (1 - e-Ni x (SF2)D/2)]A; SF2 = surviving fraction after 2 Gy.  Implications for clinical radiation therapy include: 1.  Since the number of clonogens in an occult site may vary from 10 degrees to 10(8), Ni is the major determinant of the required dose.  The intrinsic radiation sensitivity of the clonogens (SF2) is also extremely important in determining the dose.  Other factors are less influential since they vary less.  2.  The variability of Ni (8 logs) is larger than the variation in cell number seen with gross disease (1 cm3 versus 1000 cm3, 3 logs).  When Ni approximately 10(8), the required dose approaches that needed for small volume gross disease (10(9) cells, 1 cm3).  3.  The dose prescribed to elective sites should reflect the risk of occult disease based on the primary tumor site, stage, and grade.  4.  Regions where clinicoradiologic evaluation is difficult (e.g., pelvis and obese neck) require higher doses because macroscopic tumor deposits may exist.  5.  Relatively low doses (10 to 30 Gy) are often thought to be inadequate for microscopic tumor.  However, similar doses have been reported to sterilize microscopic tumor in ovarian, rectal, bladder, breast, and head and neck carcinomas.  Relatively low doses should not be discounted since they may be useful in select cases when normal tissue tolerances and/or previous irradiation treatment limit the radiation dose.",3
"Traumatic rupture of the thoracic aorta presenting as transient paraplegia.  A patient involved in a high-speed motor vehicle accident presented paraplegic to the emergency department.  He was noted to have an abnormal chest x-ray and, subsequently, underwent aortography which revealed aortic transection.  The patient's paraplegia resolved spontaneously prior to definitive aortic repair hours later.  Aortic rupture presenting as paraplegia is a rare association, but one an emergency physician should be cognizant of, especially in the case of blunt or decelerating trauma.",13
"Application of the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire to a population of alcoholics and other substance abusers.  To assess its construct validity and application, Cloninger's Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) was administered to 267 inpatient substance abusers.  One hundred seventy-two of the patients were alcoholic, 47 abused stimulants, and 48 abused other drugs, primarily benzodiazepines, marijuana, or were polysubstance abusers.  Of the sample 33.8% were female.  Analyses were conducted to (1) determine whether TPQ scores could be used to classify alcoholics as either Cloninger Type I or Type II; (2) examine the intercorrelations of TPQ scales and identify differences in these patterns due to drug of choice; (3) replicate previously obtained gender differences on the TPQ.  The results indicate that (1) TPQ scores did not classify the alcoholics into the expected frequencies for Type I and Type II; (2) the scales were not independent and did not give rise to any differences among drug user groups, but (3) did confirm previously reported gender differences.  These results indicate that Cloninger's model and the TPQ must be subjected to careful empirical study prior to their widespread acceptance.",20
"Primary repair for complete atrioventricular canal: recommendation for early primary repair.  Forty patients with complete atrioventricular canal (CAVC) underwent primary repair at Fukuoka Children's Hospital in Fukuoka, Japan, between August 1, 1981 and July 31, 1989.  The age at repair ranged from 2 months to 6 years (mean 19 months); weight ranged from 2.3 to 22 kg.  The surgical mortality was 2.5%.  Justification for early primary repair was examined.  Eleven patients underwent repair before 6 months of age (Group 1), 12 patients, between 7 and 11 months of age (Group 2), and 17 patients, after 12 months of age (Group 3).  Degenerative changes in the atrioventricular valve increased significantly as age at repair increased (p less than 0.05 Group 1 versus Group 3).  The incidence of residual mitral regurgitation tended to increase in the order of Group 1, 2 and 3, though the degree ranged from trivial to mild.  Study of the left atrium/aorta ratio by echocardiography revealed that stable values of around 1.1 in Groups 1 and 2 and around 1.3 in Group 3 continued during the follow-up period of 3 years.  Assessment of the diameter of the repaired mitral valve in the mean interval of 26 months in groups 1 and 2 revealed normal growth of the mitral valve annulus.  The angle between the repaired mitral valve and ventricular septum, which can be affected by the growth of the ventricular septum, converged to normal range in the mean interval of 26 months.  Postoperative pulmonary vascular resistance in Groups 2 and 3 was higher at 4.4 +/- 2.3 and 6.3 +/- 2.2, respectively, than in Group 1 at 3.3 +/- 2.2 (p less than 0.01 versus Group 3).",13
"Orthotic stabilization of thoracolumbar injuries. A biomechanical analysis of the Jewett hyperextension orthosis.  Spinal orthoses have been traditionally used in the management of thoracolumbar injuries treated with or without surgical stabilization.  However, the orthotic treatment modality in the management of spinal fractures remains subjective since few objective data are available on the effectiveness of orthoses in stabilizing injured segments.  This study used a finite element model of the spine to evaluate the effectiveness of a hyperextension orthosis in controlling the progression of deformities at the injury site under gravitational and flexion loads.  Two types of injuries were simulated: a single-level injury at T12-L1 and a two-level injury at T11-T12-L1 segments.  An injury of increasing severity was simulated by progressively reducing the bending stiffness of the affected segments relative to the normal values in flexion-extension mode.  The interaction of a three-point hyperextension orthosis with the spine was simulated using experimentally measured stiffness properties of the orthosis.  The authors' results suggest that in single-level injuries that cause up to 50% loss of segmental stiffness, the orthosis can restore normal resistance to deformity at the injured segments, under gravitational as well as large flexion loads.  In loss of stiffness between 50% and 85% of normal, such as severe two-column disruptions, the orthosis can restore resistance to deformity under restricted patient activity level in the brace (low-flexion moment).  Beyond 85% loss of segmental stiffness, such as three-column injuries, the orthosis alone appears to be ineffective in preventing progression of deformity.",20
"Alcohol consumption and blood pressure: a comparison of native Japanese to American men.  We compared the cross-sectional association of alcohol consumption with blood pressure in 810 Japanese men (JM) living in Tokyo and 946 white men (WM) living in New York.  Mean systolic (JM and WM, p less than 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (JM, p less than 0.002; WM, p less than 0.001) were associated with alcohol consumption in both groups.  Compared to abstainers, the heaviest drinkers had the highest systolic (JM, p = 0.001; WM, p less than 0.01) and diastolic (JM, p less than 0.002; WM, p less than 0.05) blood pressures.  The relation of blood pressure to alcohol intake was J-shaped in the Americans, but linear in the Japanese.  Exploratory analyses revealed that the J-shape may have been due to under-reporting of heavy alcohol ingestion by American abstainers.  When abstainers were excluded, the relationships were similar in both the American and Japanese.  The positive association between blood pressure and alcohol consumption persisted after adjustment for age, cigarette smoking, use of antihypertensive medications, body mass index, heart rate, abdominal skinfold thickness, hematocrit, fasting blood glucose, serum uric acid levels and urinary sodium/potassium ratio.  Alcohol use was also related to prevalence of hypertension.  These findings confirm the presence of an independent association between alcohol intake and blood pressure in both JM and WM and suggest that, despite differences in the metabolism of alcohol, the relation of alcohol consumption to blood pressure is similar in both nationalities.",13
"Cardioprotective effects of amlodipine on ischemia and reperfusion in two experimental models.  The cardioprotective effect of amlodipine, a long-acting dihydropyridine derivative, was studied in 2 experimental models of ischemia and reperfusion.  Isolated and blood-perfused feline hearts were made globally ischemic for 60 minutes and then reperfused for 60 minutes.  Alterations of left ventricular developed pressure and compliance were monitored in both amlodipine-treated hearts and saline-treated control animals.  Changes in perfusion pressure indicated that amlodipine significantly reduced myocardial oxygen consumption and coronary vascular resistance.  Furthermore, a progressive increase in resting left ventricular diastolic pressure indicated that amlodipine, administered before the onset of global ischemia, attenuated the development of ischemic contracture.  Return of contractile function 60 minutes after reperfusion and maintenance of tissue concentrations of electrolytes were significantly better in the amlodipine-treated group than in the control animals.  In intact canine hearts, regional myocardial ischemia was induced for 90 minutes, followed by 6 hours of reperfusion.  Although the hemodynamic variables and the size of the region of risk did not differ significantly between treated animals and control animals, the infarct size was significantly smaller in the amlodipine-treated group than in the control animals, and a gradual reduction in coronary blood flow was observed in the control group that was prevented in the amlodipine group.  A comparison of these findings with those observed with oxygen radical scavengers also is discussed.  A detailed report of these studies was published in The American Journal of Cardiology (1989;64:101I-116I).  This review is included here to maintain continuity of the symposium for the convenience of the reader.",13
"Massive allografts in salvage revisions of failed total knee arthroplasties.  Ten patients with failed total knee arthroplasties and severe bone loss were treated with massive whole distal femur and proximal tibial allografts in combination with prosthetic implants.  Fourteen allografts were inserted either as invaginated or segmental grafts and were rigidly fixed to the host bone.  Clinically and roentgenographically, 12 of 14 grafts (86%) seemed to have united to the host bone.  The average range of motion was 92 degrees.  Five patients developed complications; two of these involved the allograft (nonunion and fracture) and two were caused by inadequate healing at the ligament-allograft junction.  One patient had a late infection.  With careful planning and improved surgical techniques, these complications can be avoided.  The massive allograft-prosthesis composite techniques is a viable reconstructive alternative worthy of further clinical trials.",22
"Porcelain and resin veneers clinically evaluated: 2-year results.  A clinical comparison of two different types of dental veneers--baked porcelain veneer and heat-and-pressure processed urethane resin veneer--was made after 2 years.  Although the esthetic appearance and gingival response were equal for both systems, the resin veneers had a greater tendency to chip and fracture.  By the end of 2 years, 20% of the resin veneers had failed, whereas all of the porcelain veneers remained.",22
"Primary malignant melanoma of the lower respiratory tract. Report of a case and literature review.  The authors report a case of primary bronchial malignant melanoma, occurring in a 34-year-old woman presenting with persistent cough.  At bronchoscopic examination, a polypoid mass was found to occlude the left mainstem bronchus.  Biopsies showed a malignant epithelioid tumor resembling an atypical carcinoid.  Histochemistry, electron microscopic study, and immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis of melanoma.  Physical examination and additional clinical history to exclude other possible primary sites were negative.  The patient underwent thoracotomy with left pneumonectomy.  Nineteen months after resection she was found to have a histologically similar tumor involving her left adrenal gland.  Review of the literature shows that melanoma of the lower respiratory tract has been reported only in adults and has a tendency to present as a central polypoid growth that may be responsive to surgical resection.",3
"Electrophysiological spectrum of inclusion body myositis.  We present electrodiagnostic data on 30 patients with inclusion body myositis (IBM) in order to better delineate its electrophysiological features.  Comprehensive electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS) were performed in all cases.  Twelve patients had single fiber electromyography (SFEMG).  EMG showed abundant short-small motor unit potentials (MUP) with fibrillations and positive sharp waves in 56.6% of patients, and a mixed pattern of large and small MUP in 36.7%.  In 6.7%, only ""neurogenic"" features were seen.  NCS were slow in 33.3%.  SFEMG revealed a mildly abnormal jitter and a slightly increased fiber density.  IBM demonstrates a heterogeneous EMG profile.  A pattern of large and small MUP is highly suggestive of IBM but is seen in only about one third of cases.",4
"Effects of theophylline, atenolol and their combination on myocardial ischemia in stable angina pectoris.  The effects of theophylline (400 mg twice a day), atenolol (50 mg twice a day) and their combination on myocardial ischemia were studied in 9 patients with stable angina pectoris in a randomized, single-blind, triple crossover trial.  Placebo was administered to the patients during the run-in and the run-off periods.  A treadmill exercise test and 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring were obtained at the end of each treatment period.  Compared with placebo, theophylline significantly improved the time to onset of myocardial ischemia (1 mm of ST-segment depression) from 7.8 +/- 3.7 to 9.5 +/- 3.7 minutes (p less than 0.03) and the exercise duration from 9 +/- 3.4 to 10.1 +/- 3.5 minutes (p less than 0.04).  During atenolol and during combination treatment, the time to the onset of ischemia and the exercise duration were similar (10.8 +/- 4.2 and 11.2 +/- 3.2 minutes, 11.2 +/- 3.6 and 11.5 +/- 3.2 minutes, respectively) and longer than during theophylline administration (p less than 0.05).  Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring showed that, during theophylline administration, the heart rate was higher than during placebo throughout the 24 hours (p less than 0.05).  During atenolol and during combination treatment the heart rate was similar and in both cases lower than during placebo (p less than 0.05).  Compared with placebo, theophylline decreased the total ischemic time from 97 +/- 110 to 70 +/- 103 minutes (p less than 0.05).",13
"Bronchodilator response to ipratropium bromide in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.  Although the muscarinic antagonist Ipratropium bromide is used clinically as a bronchodilator in infants ventilated because of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), no studies have compared the response or efficacy of different dosages or its effectiveness in combination with beta-adrenergic agonists.  We measured the response of respiratory system mechanics in 10 ventilated infants (25 +/- 2 days of age) to 75, 125, and 175 micrograms ipratropium bromide (IB), 125 micrograms IB plus 0.04 mg salbutamol (SAL), 175 micrograms IB plus 0.04 mg SAL, and saline vehicle, delivered via nebulizer into the ventilator circuit.  Respiratory system resistance (Rrs) and compliance (Crs) were measured by the passive flow-volume technique.  Rrs and Crs were measured before and at 1 to 2 h and at 4 h after delivery of the five drug dosages or saline.  All six studies were completed within a 72-h period.  Saline had no significant effect on mechanics.  Significant responses to ipratropium alone were seen only after 175 micrograms where Rrs decreased 20 +/- 3% (SEM) (p less than 0.05) at 1 to 2 h and 16 +/- 5% (p less than 0.05) at 4 h.  After 125 micrograms IB + SAL and 175 micrograms IB + SAL, Rrs was significantly decreased both at 1 to 2 h and at 4 h, and Crs was significantly increased 20 +/- 6% and 20 +/- 4%, respectively, at 1 to 2 h.  The greatest decrease in Rrs (26 +/- 6%) was seen 1 to 2 h after 175 micrograms IB + salbutamol.",7
"The use of gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging to determine lesion site in traumatic facial paralysis.  Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging has been used to evaluate 20 patients with surgically confirmed facial nerve lesions.  When the nerve could be seen, gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging accurately revealed the lesion site as well as the known extent, which in some cases was not predicted by topognostic testing.  This technique appears to provide accurate lesion-site testing and may have importance in surgical planning.  Currently used topognostic tests of facial nerve function are frequently inaccurate and can only determine the most proximal lesion site when there are multiple or extensive lesions.  The focal nerve enhancement seen in nerve injury, globally increased signal intensity within the temporal bone after trauma, and increased signal intensity within the dura after surgery can occasionally mask nerve lesions and may be confused with tumors.",22
"Modeling human performance in running.  This paper focuses on the characteristics of a model interpreting the effect of training on athletic performance.  The model theory is presented both mathematically and graphically.  In the model, a systematically quantified impulse of training produces dual responses: fitness and fatigue.  In the absence of training, both decay exponentially with time.  With repetitive training, these responses satisfy individual recurrence equations.  Fitness and fatigue are combined in a simple linear difference equation to predict performance levels appropriate to the intensity of training being undertaken.  Significant observed correlation of model-predicted performance with a measure of actual performance during both training and tapering provides validation of the model for athletes and nonathletes alike.  This enables specific model parameters to be estimated and can be used to optimize future training regimens for any individual.",22
"Differential effect of oncotic pressure on cerebral and extracerebral water content during cardiopulmonary bypass in rabbits.  To study the effect of oncotic pressure on brain water content during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), 14 anesthetized New Zealand White rabbits underwent 60 min of nonpulsatile CPB at normothermia.  Animals were grouped according to the composition of the circuit priming fluid.  Group 1 animals (n = 7) received a priming fluid (6.5% hydroxyethyl starch in 0.72 N NaCl; 323 +/- 13 mOsm/kg [mean +/- SD]) that maintained normal colloid oncotic pressure (COP) during CPB (19.0 +/- 1.5 mmHg).  Group 2 animals (n = 7) received a priming fluid (0.9 N NaCl; 324 +/- 23 mOsm/kg) that led to a hypooncotic state (COP = 6.2 +/- 1.2 mmHg).  Blood chemistries and hemodynamics were recorded every 15 min during CPB.  Animals were given additional priming fluid and sodium bicarbonate during CPB to maintain a circuit flow of 85 ml.kg-1.min-1 and arterial pH greater than 7.35.  There were no significant differences between groups 1 and 2 with respect to temperature, central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure, PaO2, PaCO2, plasma sodium concentration, or osmolality at any time during CPB, although osmolality increased in both groups.  After 60 min of bypass, animals were killed and organ water contents were determined by wet/dry weight ratios.  A separate group of nine similarly prepared and anesthetized animals that did not undergo cannulation or CPB also underwent measurement of plasma chemistries and tissue water contents and served as nonbypass controls (group 3).  Brain and kidney water contents were unaffected by oncotic pressure, whereas duodenum and skeletal muscle had significantly greater water content (P = 0.003 and P = 0.008, respectively) after hypooncotic CPB.",9
"Contribution of transesophageal echocardiography to patient diagnosis and treatment: a prospective analysis.  The capability of transesophageal (TEE) versus transthoracic (TTE) echocardiography as a diagnostic tool in clinical practice was prospectively examined in 86 consecutive cases.  A conclusive diagnosis was possible in 95% with TEE, whereas the same result was achieved in 48% by TTE.  Specifically, TEE provided a conclusive diagnosis in 14 of 16 cases of infective endocarditis, while TTE gave this result in 4 of the 16 cases (p less than 0.001).  Similarly, TEE allowed a conclusive diagnosis in 11 of 11 instances of aortic dissection, while TTE gave this indication in two cases (p less than 0.001).  TEE was similarly effective in eight of eight cases of atrial thrombi, whereas TTE gave the diagnosis in three of eight cases (p less than 0.01).  In five subjects with intracardiac masses, TEE gave a conclusive diagnosis in all five, whereas TTE was able to diagnose conclusively in one subject (p less than 0.02).  In seven patients with mitral regurgitation, TEE gave the conclusive diagnosis in all seven and TTE was able to provide this information in four (p = NS).  TEE was able to provide a conclusive diagnosis in four patients with aortic insufficiency, and TTE gave the same information in two of the four (p = NS).  In 14 patients with prosthetic valve dysfunction, TEE gave the diagnosis in 12 and TTE gave it in eight patients (p = NS).  Both methods gave a conclusive diagnosis in 13 out of 13 cases of mitral stenosis (p = NS).  Also, TEE provided a conclusive diagnosis in eight of eight patients with adult congenital heart disease and TTE gave this information in four (p = NS).",13
"Cardioprotective effects of carnitine in extensive aortocoronary bypass grafting: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.  The cardioprotective effects of carnitine were tested in patients undergoing multiple aortocoronary bypass grafting.  Intermittent aortic cross-clamping at 28 degrees C was used.  Mean total cross-clamping time was 30 +/- 11 min.  Patients were randomized into three groups: a control group receiving placebo (group 1), a group pretreated with 3 g carnitine intravenously before cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (group 2), and a group pretreated with 6 g carnitine intravenously (group 3).  The markers of myocardial ischemia included levels of adenosine triphosphate, its catabolites, and creatine phosphate in transmural left ventricular biopsy specimens taken at the beginning and end of CPB, as well as hemodynamic recovery during weaning from CPB and for the next 24 h.  The intravenous infusion of carnitine (3 or 6 g) had no hemodynamic effect.  At the end of CPB myocardial tissue levels of adenosine triphosphate and creatine phosphate did not differ significantly among the groups (P greater than 0.05).  Recovery of cardiac function during weaning from CPB and for the following 24 h was similar in all three groups (P greater than 0.05).  It is concluded that pretreatment with carnitine neither facilitates weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass in patients undergoing aortocoronary bypass surgery nor favorably affects hemodynamic function during the next 24 h.",13
"Mechanism of stroke in patients taking aspirin.  During a 1-year period, we prospectively studied the mechanism and severity of stroke in 47 patients sustaining a cerebral infarction while taking aspirin.  The mechanism of stroke was undetermined in 12 patients (26%).  In the remaining 35 patients, we identified 39 potential mechanisms: large-artery atherosclerosis (19 patients, 40%), cardioembolism (15 patients, 32%), and small-vessel occlusive disease (5 patients, 11%).  Of 11 patients with carotid atherosclerosis and stroke, 9 (82%) had greater than 90% carotid stenosis or occlusion; of 12 patients with stroke of undetermined mechanism, 10 (83%) had previous stroke, of which 8 were also of undetermined mechanisms.  Disability after stroke was moderate or severe in 27 patients (57%).  These data suggest that (1) stroke in patients taking aspirin has a variety of etiologies and frequently causes moderate or severe disability; (2) patients with carotid disease failing aspirin often have high-grade carotid stenosis or occlusion; (3) stroke of undetermined mechanism may recur more frequently than other stroke subtypes in patients taking aspirin.",9
"Effect on outcome of prolonged exposure of patients to nitrous oxide.  Prolonged (several days or repeated) exposure to nitrous oxide (N2O) can cause injury or death.  To assess whether relatively prolonged anesthesia with N2O in normal patients might similarly cause untoward effects, we investigated whether the addition of N2O to isoflurane anesthesia caused injury to patients having surgical resection of acoustic neuroma lasting approximately 10 h.  Twenty-six patients undergoing surgical resection of acoustic neuroma were randomly assigned to a regimen that included or excluded N2O (50%-60%) during isoflurane anesthesia plus intravenous adjuvants.  On average, slightly less isoflurane (0.24%) was used during anesthesia with N2O.  We measured standard clinical variables (blood pressure, heart rate), oxygen saturation, neurologic status, pain, and the incidence and type of morbid outcomes.  Exposure to N2O did not increase the incidence of morbid outcomes (including hepatic injury, infection, or hypoxemia), prolong hospitalization, or increase common postoperative complaints such as nausea, vomiting, coughing, or headache.  Patients anesthetized with either regimen were equally satisfied with their anesthetic.",22
"Diet, smoking, and alcohol: influence on coronary heart disease risk.  The Framingham study on coronary heart disease (CHD) has shown that life-style, particularly diet, smoking, and alcohol consumption, has a great impact on the incidence of CHD.  Blood lipoproteins, rather than total blood cholesterol, have been found to be more accurate predictors of CHD risk.  Blood triglyceride, previously considered to have little bearing on CHD risk, was found to have a negative impact in many cases.  A population subgroup with high triglyceride greater than or equal to 1.7 mmol/L (greater than or equal to 150 mg/dL), low high-density lipoprotein less than or equal to 1.04 mmol/L (less than or equal to 40 mg/dL), increased insulin resistance, and a higher incidence of diabetes mellitus has been found to be at increased risk for CHD.  Diet intervention trials have shown that a reduction in total cholesterol and saturated fat consumption produced reduction in CHD incidence proportionate to the fall in cholesterol.  Cigarette smoking increased CHD risk moderately; those who smoked one pack per day had twice the risk of nonsmokers.  Alcohol consumption actually lowered CHD incidence in the Framingham study; however, when alcohol consumption was greater than two drinks per day, a rise in mortality from cancer and stroke was observed.",13
"Morphological and biochemical changes in gastric mucosa of aging rats.  Although previous data from this laboratory have indicated that aging is associated with increased gastric mucosal proliferative activity, no direct assessment of proliferative potential of the tissue has been made during aging.  In order to assess this, and to determine whether changes in mucosal proliferative potential would be reflected in growth of the tissue, we have examined the labeling index (LI), height and morphology of the gastric mucosa in young (4-month-old) and aged (24-month-old) Fischer-344 rats.  In addition, tyrosine kinase (Tyr-k) activity and the levels of phosphotyrosine proteins were determined to evaluate their relationship to mucosal proliferative activity.  Histologic evaluation revealed a marked atrophy of the mucosal glandular component with 32% reduction in height in aged rats when compared with young animals.  In aged rats, there was also a decrease in gland density, resulting in a reduction in the number of epithelial cells of all types with evidence of decreased secretory activity.  Despite the occurrence of mucosal atrophy in aged rats, LI in these animals was significantly increased by 28%.  This was associated with a parallel rise in mucosal Tyr-k activity, and a two- to threefold increase in the relative concentrations of seven phosphotyrosine membrane proteins with Mr of 120, 105, 90, 60, 55, 48 and 32 kDa.  We conclude that (1) although aging is associated with increased gastric mucosal proliferative activity, this does not result in mucosal growth and that (2) Tyr-k and tyrosine phosphorylation of certain proteins play a role in the regulation of gastric mucosal cell proliferation during aging.",22
"Is menarche associated with diabetic retinopathy?  The goal of this study was to evaluate the association between menarchal status and diabetic retinopathy.  Diabetic retinopathy was present in 51 of 129 females; 7 were premenarchal, and 44 were postmenarchal.  The range of severity of retinopathy was greater in the postmenarchal group.  In multivariate analyses, duration of diabetes, menarchal status, and diastolic blood pressure were associated with the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy.  After partitioning the duration of diabetes into years before and years after menarche, both were significant, but the number of years of diabetes after menarche was more strongly associated.  At a 4-yr follow-up examination, more postmenarchal than premenarchal females had progression of their retinopathy (P = 0.06).  These data suggest that stage of sexual development, as reflected by menarchal status, is associated with the presence and possibly the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy.",17
"Rapid visual colorimetry of peritoneal lavage fluid.  STUDY HYPOTHESIS: That visual colorimetry can be used to rapidly and precisely estimate the erythrocyte count of 1:5 dilutions of simulated peritoneal lavage fluid.  POPULATION: Fifty-four normal adult human subjects.  METHODS: The automated or chamber RBC count is often used on fluid obtained by peritoneal lavage in patients with abdominal trauma to help determine the need for surgery.  Unfortunately, this method sometimes results in excessive delay.  We designed and built a simple colorimeter that facilitated rapid direct visual comparison of unknown samples with known color standards.  A radiograph view box was used as a light source.  Standards were prepared in 16-mm glass tubes to simulate peritoneal lavage fluid with RBC counts ranging from 0 to 140,000 in 10,000 cell/microL increments; 1:5 dilutions with water were used throughout to reduce opacity.  Thimerosal was added to unknowns and standards to stabilize color; all samples were kept refrigerated at 4 C when not in use.  In a double-blind in-vitro study, each subject matched 20 randomly distributed unknowns ranging from 12,000 to 131,000 erythrocytes/microL to the nearest standard.  RESULTS: The mean absolute error for all 1,080 determinations was 3,560 RBC/microL (95% CI = 4,290-4,830; SD = 4,560; t = 39.6; df = 1,079; P less than .001).  This method correctly predicted the RBC count to within 9,000 cells/microL 95% of the time.  CONCLUSION: Visual comparison of 1:5 dilutions of simulated peritoneal lavage fluid with known color standards can be used to rapidly and precisely estimate the erythrocyte count.",20
"Poly(L-lactide) implants in repair of defects of the orbital floor: an animal study.  Because of the life-long presence of alloplastic, nonresorbable orbital floor implants and the complications of their use mentioned in literature, the use of a resorbable material appears to be preferable in the repair of orbital floor defects.  A high-molecular-weight, as-polymerized poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) was used for repair of orbital floor defects of the blowout type in goats.  An artificial defect was created in the bony floor of both orbits.  Reconstruction of the orbital floor was then carried out using a concave PLLA implant of 0.4-mm thickness.  At 3, 6, 12, 19, 26, 52, and 78 weeks postoperatively, one goat was killed.  Microscopic examination showed full encapsulation of the implant by connective tissue after 3 weeks.  After 6 weeks, resorption and remodeling of the bone at the points of support of the implant could be detected.  A differentiation between the sinus and orbital sides of the connective tissue capsule was observed.  The orbital side showed a significantly more dense capsule than the antral side, which had a loose appearance.  At 19 weeks, a bony plate was progressively being formed, and at 78 weeks, new bone had fully covered the plate on the antral and orbital side.  No inflammation or rejection of the PLLA implant was seen.",20
"Impact of marrow cytogenetics and morphology on in vitro hematopoiesis in the myelodysplastic syndromes: comparison between recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (CSF) and granulocyte-monocyte CSF.  Marrow cells from 36 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) (13 refractory anemia [RA], 14 refractory anemia with excess of blasts [RAEB], 9 RAEB in transformation [RAEB-T]) were evaluated for their in vitro proliferative and differentiative responsiveness to recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or granulocyte-monocyte CSF (GM-CSF).  GM-CSF exerted a stronger proliferative stimulus than G-CSF for marrow myeloid clonal growth (CFU-GM) in these patients (44 v 12 colonies per 10(5) nonadherent buoyant bone marrow cells [NAB], respectively, P less than .025).  GM-CSF stimulated increased CFU-GM growth in the 16 patients with abnormal marrow cytogenetics in comparison with the 20 patients who had normal cytogenetics (52 and 30 colonies per 10(5) NAB, respectively, P less than .05), whereas no such difference could be demonstrated with G-CSF (11 and 16 colonies per 10(5) NAB, respectively).  In contrast, granulocytic differentiation of marrow cells was induced in liquid culture by G-CSF in 15 of 32 (47% patients), while GM-CSF did so in only 4 of 18 (22%) patients (P less than .025) including, for RAEB/RAEB-T patients: 9 of 18 versus 0 of 9, respectively (P less than .025).  For MDS patients with normal cytogenetics, G-CSF- and GM-CSF-induced marrow cell granulocytic differentiation in 12 of 18 (67%) versus 3 of 11 (27%), respectively (P less than .025), contrasted with granulocytic induction in only 3 of 14 (21%) and 1 of 7 (14%) patients with abnormal cytogenetics, respectively.  We conclude that G-CSF has greater granulocytic differentiative and less proliferative activity for MDS marrow cells than GM-CSF in vitro, particularly for RAEB/RAEB-T patients and those with normal cytogenetics.",14
"Predictors of quitting smoking: the NHANES I followup experience.  There are no published prospective studies on the predictors of spontaneously quitting cigarette smoking in a nationally-representative U.S.  population.  This paper describes such a study, using a cohort taken from the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I, 1971-1975) and traced by the NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup Survey (1982-1984).  ""Successful"" quitting (for at least 1 year at time of followup) was ascertained among 4779 adults (age 25-74 years) who were smokers at the time of NHANES I and not disabled at followup.  Independent predictors of quitting (by proportional hazards multiple regression) were: (1) older age; (2) White race; (3) fewer cigarettes smoked/day; (4) higher household income; and (5) hospitalization in the followup period.  Predictors of relapse (ex-smokers at NHANES I who were smoking again at time of followup) were: (1) younger age; (2) urban residence; and (3) female gender.  These findings have implications for intervention strategies, public health projections and further research.",22
"Extracellular matrix gene expression increases preferentially in rat lipocytes and sinusoidal endothelial cells during hepatic fibrosis in vivo.  Whether parenchymal or nonparenchymal liver cells play a predominant role in the pathophysiology of hepatic fibrosis has not been firmly established in vivo.  We have addressed this question by quantitating the relative abundance of specific mRNAs for collagen types I, III, and IV, and laminin in purified populations of hepatocytes, sinusoidal endothelial cells, and lipocytes from normal and fibrotic rat liver.  In normal liver, type I collagen gene expression was minimal in all cell types; mRNA for types III and IV collagen were apparent in endothelial cells and lipocytes, but not in hepatocytes.  Laminin mRNA was present in all cell types.  Induction of fibrogenesis by either bile duct ligation or carbon tetrachloride administration was associated with a substantial increase in mRNA for types I and III collagen in nonparenchymal cells.  Lipocytes from fibrotic animals exhibited a greater than 30-fold increase in type I collagen mRNA relative to normal lipocytes, and greater than 40-fold relative to hepatocytes.  Type III collagen mRNA reached 5 times that in normal lipocytes and greater than 120 times that in hepatocytes.  Endothelial cells exhibited an isolated increase in type I collagen mRNA, reaching five times that in normal liver.  Type IV collagen and laminin gene expression were not significantly increased in nonparenchymal cells during fibrogenesis; in fact, mRNA for type IV collagen and laminin decreased by up to 50% in endothelial cells.  Despite the pronounced changes that occurred in matrix gene expression in nonparenchymal cells during fibrogenesis, no change was noted in hepatocytes.  We conclude that nonparenchymal liver cells, particularly lipocytes, are important effectors of hepatic fibrosis in vivo.",5
"Temporary amelioration of hyperlipidemia in low density lipoprotein receptor-deficient rabbits transplanted with genetically modified hepatocytes.  Familial hypercholesterolemia is an inherited disease in humans that is associated with coronary artery disease and is caused by a deficiency of the receptor that mediates the internalization of low density lipoprotein (LDL).  We have used an animal model for familial hypercholesterolemia, the Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbit, to design a therapeutic approach for this disease, which attempts to correct the hepatic defect in LDL receptor expression.  Hepatocytes were harvested from WHHL rabbits, plated in primary cultures, and exposed to recombinant retroviruses capable of efficiently transferring a functional human LDL receptor gene.  Genetically modified cells were harvested and infused into the portal vein of WHHL recipients, who were analyzed for metabolic consequences of human LDL receptor expression.  Each animal exhibited a statistically significant decrease in total serum cholesterol 2-6 days after transplantation, with an eventual return to pretreatment levels.  Proviral DNA sequences and virus-directed transcripts were detected in liver tissue 24 hr after transplantation.  In situ hybridization demonstrated provirus expression in a small population of hepatocytes distributed in periportal sections of the liver.  This study illustrates the potential of somatic gene therapy in ameliorating hyperlipidemia associated with familial hypercholesterolemia.",17
"Prolonged paralysis following suxamethonium and the use of neostigmine.  A case of prolonged neuromuscular block following the administration of suxamethonium is reported.  Three hours after administration of suxamethonium, a well defined, recovering phase II block was demonstrated with a T4:T1 ratio of 0.25, and neostigmine was administered.  Although the T4:T1 ratio was improved to 0.9, T1 remained at 25% of control, and significant paralysis persisted which responded to administration of cholinesterase.  It is concluded that neuromuscular monitoring cannot reliably predict reversibility in such cases and that, even after 3 h, antagonism of prolonged suxamethonium block should commence with cholinesterase, followed by neostigmine if necessary.",22
"Electroencephalographic activity related to palatal myoclonus in REM sleep.  Polysomnography, including electroencephalography, electromyography and electro-oculography was performed in three patients with palatal myoclonus (PM).  The amplitude of the myoclonus decreased during sleep.  The frequency did not change during non-REM sleep, but increased during REM sleep in two patients.  Ocular myoclonus synchronized with PM disappeared during deep sleep stages in two patients and reappeared during REM sleep in one of them.  In the other patient, ocular myoclonus was noted only in REM sleep, being absent even when the patient was awake.  All patients showed episodic EEG activities synchronous with myoclonic jerks only in REM sleep.  These episodes were noted 5-15 times throughout the night, and each episode lasting for 1-7 s.  They were negative or positive waves of saw-tooth appearance which were distributed predominantly in the central region.  During the episodes, the frequency of myoclonic jerks increased in two patients.  Although it is known that REM sleep influences PM and ocular myoclonus, this is the first report demonstrating the electroencephalographic activity associated with PM.",22
"Trend toward nonoperative management of splenic injuries.  Treatment of splenic injuries has evolved over the past decade to reflect more effort to conserve function of the spleen.  Records of 169 patients admitted over a 6-year period were identified as documenting the treatment of splenic injuries.  We collected data regarding patient age, gender, degree of hemodynamic stability, number of units of blood required, severity of splenic injury, Injury Severity Score, and results of treatment.  There were 143 adults (age greater than 16 years) and 26 pediatric patients (age less than 17 years), with mean age in the 2 groups of 31.6 and 11.4 years, respectively.  Males comprised 72% of the group, and blunt injury occurred in 154 of the 169 patients.  In the adults, splenectomy, splenorrhaphy, laparotomy without operative treatment of the spleen, and nonoperative management were observed 48%, 30%, 14%, and 8% of the time and in the pediatric group 31%, 27%, 19%, and 23% of the time, respectively.  By using operative splenic repair techniques and increased use of nonoperative management, the splenic salvage rate has increased in the last 6 years from 41% to 61% without an increase in morbidity and mortality.  Incidence of spleen salvage correlated with severity of spleen and overall injury and cardiovascular stability.",20
"Lack of change in neurochemical markers during the postepileptic phase of intrahippocampal tetanus toxin syndrome in rats.  The chronic epileptic syndrome induced by injecting tetanus toxin into rat hippocampus causes functional changes that essentially are permanent, outlasting the period of active seizures by at least 1 year.  These long-term changes have been characterized by an impaired performance on a range of behavioral tasks, which in turn have been associated with a physiologic depression of hippocampal evoked responses but not with any discernible histopathology.  In the present study, we examined the hippocampi of rats in the postseizure phase of the tetanus toxin model and observed no significant changes in the concentration of neurochemical markers for six neurotransmitters.  Therefore, the long-term reduction in hippocampal excitability cannot be attributed to any major loss of afferents or hippocampal neurons using aspartate, acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, norepinephrine (NE), or serotonin as their transmitters.",9
"Outlook after acute myocardial infarction in the very elderly compared with that in patients aged 65 to 75 years   Little is known concerning late outcome and prognostic factors after acute myocardial infarction in the very elderly (greater than 75 years of age).  Accordingly, this study compared the clinical course and mortality rate for up to 1 year in a large multicenter data base that included 702 patients greater than 75 years of age (mean +/- SD 81 +/- 4 years), with a less elderly subset of 1,321 patients between 65 and 75 years of age (mean 70 +/- 3 years).  The postdischarge 1 year cardiac mortality rate was 17.6% for those greater than 75 years of age compared with 12.0% for patients between 65 and 75 years of age (p less than 0.01).  There were differences in the prevalence of several factors, including female gender, history of angina pectoris, history of congestive heart failure, smoking habits and incidence of congestive heart failure during hospitalization.  Multivariate analyses of predictors of cardiac death in hospital survivors selected different factors as important in the two age subgroups; age was selected in the 65 to 75 year age group but was not an independent predictor in the very elderly.  The survival curves beginning at day 10 for patients 65 to 75 and in those greater than 75 years old were similar for up to 90 days but diverged later.  In the very elderly, 63% of late cardiac deaths were sudden or due to new myocardial infarction, similar to the causes of 67% of deaths in the younger age group.",13
"Early readmission of elderly patients with congestive heart failure.  Repetitive hospitalizations are a major health problem in elderly patients with chronic disease, accounting for up to one fourth of all inpatient Medicare expenditures.  Congestive heart failure, one of the most common indications for hospitalization in the elderly, is also associated with a high incidence of early rehospitalization, but variables identifying patients at increased risk and an analysis of potentially remediable factors contributing to readmission have not previously been reported.  We prospectively evaluated 161 patients 70 years or older that had been hospitalized with documented congestive heart failure.  Hospital mortality was 13% (n = 21).  Among patients discharged alive, 66 (47%) were readmitted within 90 days.  Recurrent heart failure was the most common cause for readmission, occurring in 38 patients (57%).  Other cardiac disorders accounted for five readmissions (8%), and noncardiac illness led to readmission in 21 cases (32%).  Factors predictive of an increased probability of readmission included a prior history of heart failure, four or more admissions within the preceding 8 years, and heart failure precipitated by an acute myocardial infarction or uncontrolled hypertension (all P less than .05).  Using subjective criteria, 25 first readmissions (38%) were judged possibly preventable, and 10 (15%) were judged probably preventable.  Factors contributing to preventable readmissions included noncompliance with medications (15%) or diet (18%), inadequate discharge planning (15%) or follow-up (20%), failed social support system (21%), and failure to seek medical attention promptly when symptoms recurred (20%).  Thus, early rehospitalization in elderly patients with congestive heart failure may be preventable in up to 50% of cases, identification of high risk patients is possible shortly after admission, and further study of nonpharmacologic interventions designed to reduce readmission frequency is justified.",13
"Angioplasty of occluded coronary arteries: use of thin shaft balloon over-the-wire system without pre-dilatation.  A retrospective review was done on 13 consecutive patients who underwent PTCA of totally occluded coronary arteries using a recently released thin shaft balloon over-the-wire angioplasty system.  Balloon size was determined by the closest fit to the arterial size and used without predilatation techniques.  This technique was initially successful in 12 patients with only 2 clinically insignificant episodes of distal embolization and one probable early reclosure.  Using thin shaft angioplasty systems, balloon dilatation of totally occluded coronary arteries can be done safely with a single balloon in many cases resulting in simplified procedures and economic benefits.",13
"Rehabilitation of chronic stroke patients: changes in functional performance.  Forty stroke patients who were at least one year post-onset completed a one-month intensive rehabilitation program.  The month before the program served as a control period.  During the program, patients received individual sessions in occupational and physical therapy four days a week, and they participated in group activities on the fifth day.  Therapy emphasized instruction in motor planning, balance and weight shift, and the use of adaptive equipment; these motor abilities were then practiced within real life situations.  The patients demonstrated significant improvement in the outcome measures of weight shift, balance, and ADL scores after the one-month rehabilitation program (weight shift: F = 16.1, p = .0001; balance: F = 6.26, p = .0007; ADL: F = 13.8, p = .0001).  They retained these new skills during a three-month follow-up period.",9
"Relation of Helicobacter pylori to the human gastric mucosa in chronic gastritis of the antrum.  The spatial relations between bacteria and the affected tissues can indicate pathogenic mechanisms.  This study was undertaken to define the spatial relation of Helicobacter pylori to the human gastric mucosa.  Antibodies against gastric mucus and ruthenium red were used to stabilise the glycoprotein structure of the mucus and glycocalyces in antral biopsy specimens from eight patients infected with H pylori.  The location of organisms and ultrastructural features were assessed using systematic scanning and transmission electron microscopy: 92 (2)% (mean (SE] of H pylori were in the pit mucus, and 7 (3)% were in the surface mucus; 60 (12)% of H pylori were close to epithelial cells, with only 5 (2)% located near the epithelial intercellular junctions.  Fine filamentous strands extended between organisms and nearby epithelial cells, with few organisms in membrane to membrane contact.  H pylori were not observed between, beneath, or within cells of the gastric mucosa.  The preferred location of H pylori in the gastric antrum is within the pit mucus close to the epithelial cell surface, with no evidence that they have a direct toxic effect on the mucosa.",5
"Age effect on prognosis for functional recovery in acute, traumatic central cord syndrome.  The purpose of this study was to determine if age is significant in functional recovery in acute, traumatic central cord syndrome (CCS).  Recovery of ambulation, ADL status, and bowel and bladder function were evaluated.  A retrospective study tested the hypothesis that functional recovery in 51 consecutive CCS patients was better in younger patients than in older patients.  Four patients, all more than 50 years, died.  Ability to ambulate independently at discharge was compared in 30 patients younger than 50 years with 21 patients 50 years or older.  Results showed that 29 of 30 (97%) of the younger patients were ambulatory compared to seven of 17 (41%) of the older patients (p less than .002).  The younger patients were also able to achieve independence in self-care and bowel and bladder function in a significantly greater proportion.  The prognosis for functional recovery in acute traumatic CCS should consider the patient's age.  The prognosis is less optimistic in older patients, but it is considerably more favorable in younger patients than previously reported.",20
"Prostacyclin and acetylcholine as screening agents for acute pulmonary vasodilator responsiveness in primary pulmonary hypertension.  Epoprostenol sodium (prostacyclin) administered intravenously is considered the standard for assessing the ability of the pulmonary circulation to vasodilate.  At present, epoprostenol sodium is an investigational drug that has limited availability.  In contrast, acetylcholine, also a pulmonary vasodilator, is readily available.  Therefore, we assessed the feasibility of using acetylcholine as an alternative to prostacyclin in testing for the capacity of the pulmonary vasculature to vasodilate.  Twenty-three patients with primary pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary arterial pressure, 58.5 +/- 13.4 mm Hg) received incremental infusions of prostacyclin and acetylcholine to predetermined maximal infusion rates as part of a battery of vasodilator agents administered according to standard protocols (mean, 5.4 +/- 1.2 agents/patient; range, 3-8 agents/patient); the administration of the different agents was timed to avoid synergistic effects.  Of all the agents tested, prostacyclin and acetylcholine were most consistently effective in evoking acute pulmonary vasodilation, and both seemed to distinguish patients capable of manifesting acute pulmonary vasodilation from those who were not.  However, at maximal doses set by protocol, prostacyclin generally elicited a greater vasodilator response than acetylcholine.  The difference in magnitude of response may have been due to use of prescribed dosages of acetylcholine that were submaximal.  In other respects, the two agents were similar; both were equally well-tolerated, and side effects were mild and resolved rapidly when the vasodilator infusions were stopped.  We conclude that in the majority of patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, acetylcholine appears to be an effective and available substitute for prostacyclin in screening for pulmonary vasodilator responsiveness.",13
"Famine in southern Ethiopia 1985-6: population structure, nutritional state, and incidence of death among children.  OBJECTIVE--To assess the effects of drought on mortality in children.  DESIGN--Prospective epidemiological study forming part of nutritional monitoring during famine relief work.  SETTING--24 Food distribution sites in Arero and Borana provinces in southern Ethiopia.  PATIENTS--A monthly average of 14,173 and 5,334 children under 5 were examined in 1985 and 1986, respectively.  Altogether 148,966 child months (105,872 for 1985 and 43,094 for 1986) were available for analysis.  INTERVENTION--The families of all children were supplied with food each month.  Basic medical care was also provided.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Mortality in children under 5.  RESULTS--A 40% increase in crude mortality was observed among children living in traditional and stable societies.  The severe consequences were observed mainly among children living in relief shelters, where a threefold to fourfold increase in crude mortality was recorded among children.  Increased childhood mortality was also associated with high prevalence of malnutrition, living in the most arid areas, and the dry season.  A long period of food aid was needed to normalise the nutritional state, especially for children living in relief shelters.  CONCLUSIONS--The most severe consequences of the widespread famine that occurred in the Arero and Borana provinces of southern Ethiopia during 1985-6 were seen among children living in relief shelters.  Early food intervention may decrease the scale of migration and thus also reduce the severe consequences of a famine.",17
"Subtle injuries of the Lisfranc joint.  In fifteen patients, a subtle injury of the Lisfranc joint (tarsometatarsal articulation) was found.  The lesion was defined as a diastasis of two to five millimeters between the bases of the first and second metatarsals, as seen on anteroposterior radiographs.  There often was a long delay between injury and diagnosis.  Eight patients were treated with a below-the-knee cast only, three had treatment with a cast and then tarsometatarsal arthrodesis, two had no initial treatment but later had arthrodesis, and two had open reduction and internal fixation.  The duration of follow-up ranged from two to thirteen years after the diagnosis.  There was no correlation between the severity of the diastasis and the patient's functional result.  Marked disability and pain persisted in seven patients, and six of them had flattening of the longitudinal arch.  Maintenance of the longitudinal arch usually was associated with a better functional outcome.  When a patient has a subtle injury of the Lisfranc joint, weight-bearing lateral radiographs of both feet are needed to identify flattening of the longitudinal arch.  Such radiographs should be made routinely in the evaluation of all injuries of the foot that may involve the Lisfranc joint.",20
"Increase of beta 1-6-branched oligosaccharides in human esophageal carcinomas invasive against surrounding tissue in vivo and in vitro.  The -GlcNAc beta 1-6Man- (beta 1-6) branched N-glycosidic oligosaccharides expressed on tumor cells have been found to contribute to malignant and metastatic potential in experimental tumor models.  Phaseolus vulgaris leukoagglutinin (L-PHA) requires the beta 1-6-linked lactosamine antenna for high-affinity binding and was used histochemically to characterize the distribution of these sugar structures in human esophageal squamous cell carcinomas from 42 patients.  Leukoagglutinin-reactive carcinoma cells in the invasive tumors were distributed predominantly on the outer surface of the tumor adjacent to the surrounding tissue.  Furthermore, when TE 1 cells, a human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma line, were cultured in a collagen gel matrix to obtain colonies in a three-dimensional form, these colonies exhibited high affinity for L-PHA binding only in the outer cell layer facing the collagen matrix, unrelated to the cell growth cycle.  These findings suggest that the increase in beta 1-6-branched oligosaccharides in esophageal carcinomas is an important trait of the tumor in the invasion into the surrounding tissue.",3
"Problem solving in implant dentistry.  Dental implants have become an accepted form of dental care, with reported functional 5-year success rates of 90% and higher.  These impressive statistics include, but do not identify, the problems that may have been created by clinical ineptitude.  Diagnostic acumen and preventive measures at each stage of the implant treatment can avoid many problems.  Also, appropriate measures of timely recognition, rescue, and repair can often restore ailing implants and their prosthetic appliances to full function.",22
"Inflation pressure requirements during coronary angioplasty.  To examine the balloon inflation pressures required for successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), the maximal inflation pressure required for 477 coronary lesions in 200 consecutive patients was determined retrospectively.  When graded balloon inflations just sufficient to achieve full expansion were used, the maximal inflation pressure used was less than or equal to 8 atm in 412 stenoses (86%) and was less than or equal to 10 atm in 463 stenoses (97%).  Successful PTCA was achieved in 98% of lesions with a 3.5% major procedural complication rate.  In a second group of 100 patients studied prospectively, the inflation pressure required to achieve full balloon expansion was less than or equal to 8 atm in 214 of 232 stenoses (92%) and less than or equal to 10 atm in 228 stenoses (98%).  Thus, PTCA of coronary stenoses can be achieved with high success rates and low complication rates when graded inflations to pressures just sufficient to achieve full balloon expansion are performed.  Most coronary stenoses will respond to pressures less than or equal to 8-10 atm.",13
"Evaluation of 13C-urea breath test in the detection of Helicobacter pylori and in monitoring the effect of tripotassium dicitratobismuthate in non-ulcer dyspepsia   Sixty nine patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia have been studied with endoscopy, biopsy, quick urease (CLO) test, Helicobacter pylori culture, and the 13C-urea breath test before and after treatment with tripotassium dicitratobismuthane (DeNol) two tablets twice daily for four weeks.  Symptoms of non-ulcer dyspepsia were recorded using a standard questionnaire.  Using H pylori culture as the gold standard, the sensitivity of the 13C-urea breath test was 90%, the specificity 98.6%, and the accuracy 94.8% with a positive predictive value of 98.2% and a negative predictive value of 92.5%.  Conversion rate from H pylori positive to negative status after treatment with tripotassium dicitratobismuthate was 17.9%.  Symptoms of non-ulcer dyspepsia improved appreciably after treatment irrespective of H pylori status.  The 13C-urea breath test is an accurate research tool suitable for serial testing and population surveys.",22
"Epidural analgesia for a parturient with herpes gestationis.  A 23-yr-old parturient with herpes gestationis spontaneously delivered a normal healthy infant under epidural analgesia.  She received five injections of bupivacaine 0.5 per cent over a ten-hour period.  There was no infection at the lumbar region, even though her body was covered with vesicles and bullae including the face and neck.  Eight months after delivery the patient still has a vesicular eruption which occurs mainly during her menses.",12
"Effects of childbearing on glucose tolerance and NIDDM prevalence [published erratum appears in Diabetes Care 1990 Nov;13(11):1138]  The goal of this study was to estimate the effects of childbearing on subsequent glucose tolerance and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) prevalence.  A sample of subjects from 64 different locations in the United States were recruited for inclusion in the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.  A complex survey design was used to select a probability sample of subjects from each location.  A total of 4577 women were recruited, of whom 3057 underwent clinical and laboratory evaluation for the presence of diabetes mellitus.  Women were classified as to their glucose tolerance based on the results of an oral glucose tolerance test or previous physician diagnosis of diabetes mellitus combined with current use of hypoglycemic medication.  Childbearing was defined as number of live births experienced by each woman at the time of the interview.  Fasting plasma glucose increased linearly with increasing number of live births (coefficient 0.009, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.006-0.012), as did the 2-h value (coefficient 0.015, 95% CI 0.009-0.021).  Adjustment for age, body mass index (BMI), education, and income substantially reduced the magnitude of the association between childbearing and either plasma glucose measurement.  When the prevalence of NIDDM in relation to childbearing was examined with logistic regression analysis, a significant linear increase in diabetes prevalence was seen with increasing number of live births (relative prevalence of NIDDM, 1 birth vs.  0 = 1.73, 95% CI 1.39-2.15), but adjustment for age, BMI, education, and income greatly reduced the magnitude of this association (relative prevalence of NIDDM, 1 birth vs.  0 = 1.07, 95% CI 0.98-1.17).",17
"HLA class I and class II antigen expression on squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.  We compared human major histocompatibility (HLA) class I and class II antigen expression on squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with that on normal mucosa.  Frozen sections of a consecutive series of 30 squamous cell carcinomas were stained with the monoclonal antibodies W6/32 (class I) and anti-DR (class II) using an immunoperoxidase technique.  Normal mucosa showed class I and class II expression in the basal layers only.  Class I expression on tumors was diffuse in 87%, patchy in 10%, and scattered in 3%.  Class II expression on tumors was diffuse in 20%, patchy in 53%, scattered in 20%, and absent in 7%.  Patterns of expression did not correlate significantly with clinical parameters, including survival, except that class II diffuse and patchy patterns were found to correlate with more poorly differentiated tumors.",3
"Immunological studies of the basis for the apathogenicity of simian immunodeficiency virus from African green monkeys.  Potential reasons for the lack of pathogenicity of the simian immunodeficiency virus SIVagm in its natural host, the African green monkey (AGM, Cercopithecus aethiops), were investigated with respect to immunological mechanisms.  The functional immune response of monkeys to infection was similar (though not identical) to that of humans to infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).  In the sera of infected animals, neutralizing antibodies were found to be low or absent, and in particular there was no neutralization of the various isolates by homologous sera.  There was no detectable antibody/complement cytotoxicity, though AGM sera were able to initiate antibody-dependent cellular cytolysis of infected cells in the presence of healthy effector peripheral blood lymphocytes.  As in the human/HIV system, macrophages from AGMs are readily infected by SIVagm.  Two possibly important differences between the AGM/SIVagm system and the human/HIV system are (i) the low immune response of the AGMs to the core protein of SIVagm and (ii) the significantly lower inhibitory effect of SIVagm proteins on the proliferation of AGM lymphocytes.",1
"Hemodynamic status in critically ill patients with and without acute heart disease.  Physicians have been urged to reduce the use of the pulmonary artery catheter.  However, there are no guidelines to help the clinician make the decision to use or withhold invasive monitoring in the individual patient.  This study was designed to examine the accuracy of physician estimates of cardiac function in a spectrum of patients with hemodynamic instability to determine whether differences in accuracy among subgroups would suggest subgroups of patients who could be managed without invasive measurements.  Physician estimates of cardiac index were found to be sufficiently accurate in patients without acute heart disease that initial management without invasive monitoring may be appropriate in selected cases.  However, due to the general inaccuracy of physician estimates, efforts to improve the accuracy of clinical judgments of cardiac function and hemodynamic status should be pursued with vigor in patients both with and without acute cardiac dysfunction.",13
"Molecular structure of a major insulin/mitogen-activated 70-kDa S6 protein kinase.  The molecular structure of a rat hepatoma 70-kDa insulin/mitogen-stimulated S6 protein kinase, obtained by molecular cloning, is compared to that of a rat homolog of the 85-kDa Xenopus S6 protein kinase alpha; both kinases were cloned from H4 hepatoma cDNA libraries.  The 70-kDa S6 kinase (calculated molecular mass of 59,186 Da) exhibits a single catalytic domain that is most closely related in amino acid sequence (56% identity) to the amino-terminal, kinase C-like domain of the rat p85 S6 kinase (calculated molecular mass of 82,695 Da); strong similarity extends through a further 67 residues carboxyl-terminal to the catalytic domain (40% identity), corresponding to a region also conserved among the kinase C family.  Outside of this segment of approximately 330 amino acids, the structures of the p70 and p85 S6 kinases diverge substantially.  The p70 S6 kinase is known to be activated through serine/threonine phosphorylation by unidentified insulin/mitogen-activated protein kinases.  A model for the regulation of p70 S6 protein kinase activity is proposed wherein the low activity of the unphosphorylated enzyme results from the binding of a basic, inhibitory pseudosubstrate site (located carboxyl-terminal to the extended catalytic domain) to an acidic substrate binding region (located amino-terminal to the catalytic domain); substrate binding is thereby prevented.  S6 kinase activation requires displacement of this inhibitory segment, which is proposed to occur consequent to its multiple phosphorylation.  The putative autoinhibitory segment contains several serine and threonine residues, each followed directly by a proline residue.  This motif may prevent autophosphorylation but permit transphosphorylation; two of these serine residues reside in a maturation promoting factor (MPF)/cdc-2 consensus motif.  Thus, hormonal regulation of S6 kinase may involve the action of MPF/cdc-2 or protein kinases with related substrate specificity.",3
"The situational riskiness of alcoholic beverages.  Using face-to-face interview data on a sample of young adults, this study investigates the perceived risk of alcohol consumption in drinking and driving, interactions with police and the probability of intoxication.  Results show that beer is perceived as less risky than liquor in two risk situations, with men and drinkers in particular ranking beer as a lower risk beverage.  When intoxication is considered, drinkers rank their preferred beverage as less risky than their alternative.  Finally, an analysis of the relative riskiness of beer in comparison to liquor reveals that beer is perceived as less risky than liquor.  This consensus does not vary significantly by sex or most other respondent characteristics.",20
"Screening for psychiatric and substance abuse disorders in clinical practice.  Psychiatric disorders, particularly depression and alcohol abuse, represent a large burden of illness to the society.  Many individuals with these disorders receive all of their care from health care providers who are not mental health specialists.  There is evidence that non-psychiatric physicians frequently do not recognize these disorders in their patients.  Screening questionnaires have been introduced to improve detection of these patients.  Several studies have found that these screening questionnaires can increase detection rates, but no important impact on patient outcomes has been demonstrated.  This review article outlines several reasons why it has been difficult to discern improvement in patient outcomes: inadequate study design, insufficient physician education, interdependence of psychiatric and medical conditions, and vague treatment guidelines.  Practical use of the current psychiatric screening questionnaires and key areas for further investigation are considered.",20
"Reduction of the membrane fluidity of human breast cancer cells by tamoxifen and 17 beta-estradiol.  The intracellular steady-state levels of methotrexate were previously shown to be reduced in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative human breast cancer MDA-MB-436 cells and ER-positive human breast cancer MCF7 cells following treatment with pharmacologically relevant concentrations of 17 beta-estradiol (E2).  We now report that both E2 and tamoxifen (TMX) significantly decreased the fluidity of MCF7 and MDA-MB-436 cellular membranes.  With E2 or TMX at concentrations greater than 1 microM, perturbations in membrane fluidity were accompanied by apparently non-ER-mediated cytotoxicity.  Alterations in membrane structure may have contributed to the cytotoxicity of high-dose endocrine therapy and to the ability of E2 to inhibit methotrexate transport and cytotoxicity in some human breast cancer cells.",3
"A reappraisal of the need for autologous blood donation in the obstetric patient.  There has been recent interest in autologous blood donation in obstetric patients, but little attention has been paid to whether such programs are needed or whether the patients that will require transfusion can be accurately predicted.  At the University of California San Diego Medical Center from July 1 to Dec.  31, 1988, there were 2265 deliveries; 13 women (0.57%) received blood transfusions.  Traditionally accepted risk factors were identified in 251 patients, with only four (1.6%) requiring transfusion.  Among the 150 patients delivered by repeat cesarean section, only one (0.7%) required blood.  one of 27 (3.7%) multiple gestations, two of eight (25%) patients with placenta previa, and none of the 66 grandmultiparous women had transfusions.  These data suggest that autologous blood donation may not be beneficial or cost effective when the low frequency of blood transfusions in this high-risk obstetric population and the difficulty in accurately predicting those likely to require transfusions are considered.",12
"Prognostic significance of nondiploid DNA determined by flow cytometry in sporadic and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma.  To clarify the role of DNA measurements in predicting outcome after surgical treatment of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), we performed flow cytometric analysis in nuclear suspensions of 119 MTC tumors.  Of the 119 patients, 63 (53%) patients had sporadic tumors and 56 (47%) patients had familial tumors; survivors were followed for a mean of 13 years.  DNA content was normal in 92 (77%) patients and abnormal (nondiploid) in 27 (23%) patients.  Ten-year cause-specific mortality rates were 12%, 42%, and 49% with diploid, tetraploid/polyploid, or aneuploid tumors (p = 0.0009) and were greater with nondiploid tumors both in the sporadic (p = 0.012) and multiple endocrine neoplasia (familial) cases (p = 0.114).  None of 27 patients with TNM stage I disease died of MTC.  In patients with TNM stages II, III, and IV disease, DNA nondiploid tumors were associated with increased deaths from MTC.  In a Cox proportional hazards model involving all 119 patients and adjusted for disease stage and inheritance pattern, nondiploid DNA was independently associated with increased deaths from MTC (p = 0.008).  In an identical Cox model restricted to the 92 DNA diploid tumors, an S-phase fraction of 15.0% or more remained a significant variable (p = 0.034) after adjustment for stage and inheritance pattern.  We therefore conclude that DNA measurements do have a role to play in predicting outcome after surgical treatment of MTC.",3
"Ability of anti-HIV agents to inhibit HIV replication in monocyte/macrophages or U937 monocytoid cells under conditions of enhancement by GM-CSF or anti-HIV antibody.  Monocyte/macrophages (M/M) are an important target cell for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in the body.  The study of HIV infection in these cells, however, is rather complicated because they represent a variable population, and because HIV entry and replication in M/M may be markedly influenced by a number of factors.  These must be considered in therapeutic approaches to HIV infection.  In the present set of experiments, we studied the interaction between certain agents which increase the infection of monocyte/macrophages (M/M) by HIV and two groups of anti-HIV agents: dideoxynucleosides and specific inhibitors of gp120-CD4 binding.  We found that the cytokine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which markedly enhances HIV replication in M/M, does not affect the activity of recombinant soluble CD4 (sCD4) or OKT4A, two agents which block gp120-CD4 binding.  However, it had varying effects on different dideoxynucleosides: GM-CSF increased the net anti-HIV activity of 3'-azido2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT), while at the same time it reduced the activity of 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC) and 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI).  These effects probably represent an interplay between varying effects of GM-CSF on drug entry and phosphorylation.  In additional experiments, we showed that very low concentrations of anti-HIV antibodies could enhance HIV infection of the U937 monocytoid cell line.  Interestingly, while this effect has been hypothesized to occur through a CD4-independent mechanism, we found that the anti-HIV activities of both sCD4 and OKT4A were unchanged under conditions of enhancement.",19
"Long-term follow-up of 24 patients undergoing radical resection for ampullary carcinoma, 1953 to 1988.  Potentially curative radical pancreaticoduodenectomy for ampullary adenocarcinoma was performed in 24 patients over a 35-year period.  The overall operative mortality was 12.5%.  Actuarial survival rate at 5 years was 61% +/- 13.4 standard error of the mean (SEM) and subsequently remained unchanged.  In the same time period, 21 patients underwent potentially curative radical pancreaticoduodenectomy for periampullary tumors of pancreatic origin.  Similar analysis showed an overall operative mortality of 23.8% and a survival rate at 5 years of 27% +/- 12.5 SEM.  The results of radical pancreaticoduodenectomy for ampullary carcinoma in the most recent years (1976 to 1988) were compared with those of former years (1953 to 1975).  There were no statistically significant differences in the 5-year survival rate; however, the operative mortality decreased from 25% in the former period to 6.3% in the recent period.  Survival was dependent on nodal status.  The 5-year survival rate was 78% +/- 11.5 SEM in the absence of nodal metastasis versus 50% +/- 25 SEM in the presence of regional nodal metastasis.  These findings support the concept that radical pancreaticoduodenectomy offers a realistic probability for cure in a selected group of patients with carcinomas of the ampulla of Vater.",3
"The Woolley and Roe case. A reassessment.  In 1953, two patients, Cecil Roe and Albert Woolley, sued their anaesthetist for alleged negligence because they had developed painful spastic paraparesis after spinal anaesthesia.  The court found that phenol, which was used to sterilise the outside of the ampoules of local anaesthetic, had percolated the glass through invisible cracks, contaminating the solution, but that the anaesthetist could not have been aware of this risk.  The case was important, despite the fact that judgement was in favour of the anaesthetist, because of the fears that it generated over the incidence of paralysis after spinal anaesthesia.  The 'invisible crack' theory has been the subject of much scepticism.  New information has been obtained, and the case re-examined objectively.  The most probable source of contamination, which led to paralysis in the two patients, and in a third who received spinal anaesthesia on the same day, has been identified.  A similar explanation may lie behind a number of other episodes of paralysis associated with spinal anaesthesia.",9
"Traumatic disruptions of the thoracic aorta: treatment and outcome.  Of 27 patients admitted to our level I trauma center with acute disruption of the thoracic aorta, two patients died of exsanguination before aortic repair.  One patient had massive leakage from the aneurysm after aortography and died during surgery.  All patients suffered from multiple injuries.  Eighty-three percent of the patients had major operations in addition to the aortic repair.  ""Clamp and sew"" technique was used in 18 patients (75%), two of whom had multiple tears of the aortic arch.  Heparin-coated shunts were used in five patients (20.8%), and a cardiopulmonary bypass was performed in one patient who had multiple tears.  Three postoperative deaths were related to polytrauma, cardiogenic shock, and sepsis.  Paraplegia developed in three patients, two of whom had multiple aortic lesions necessitating longer ischemia time during the repair.  Only one patient had complete neurologic deficit at the 1-year follow-up.  In our series, neither surgical procedure proved superior.  We conclude that the ""clamp and sew"" technique for repair of the disrupted thoracic aorta may allow for a more favorable outcome.",20
"Calcium and contractile responses to phorbol esters and the calcium channel agonist, Bay K 8644, in arteries from hypertensive rats.  This study examined the calcium dependency of contractions in arteries from rats made hypertensive by aortic coarctation and in rats with genetic hypertensive (stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats).  Mesenteric artery and aortic strips were suspended in tissue baths for isometric force recording and contractions to two drugs were characterized: 1) a phorbol ester, TPA (12-O-tetrade-canoylphorbol-13-acetate), and 2) the calcium channel agonist, Bay K 8644.  Thoracic aortae and mesenteric arteries from hypertensive rats were more sensitive to the contractile properties of the protein kinase C activator TPA than comparable arteries from normotensive rats.  In thoracic aortae from coarcted rats, the contractile activity of Bay K 8644 was potentiated compared to normotensive values.  In the presence of 19.2 mmol/L KCl, responses to Bay K 8644 in thoracic aortae from normotensive rats were potentiated and did not differ from coarcted values.  In contrast, contractions to Bay K 8644 and TPA in abdominal aortae obtained below the coarctation were not different from normotensive values.  Upon exposure to 26.2 mmol/L KCl, contractions to Bay K 8644 in abdominal aortae were potentiated and those in aortae from coarcted rats did not differ from sham values.  Contractile responses to both drugs were blocked by nifedipine and verapamil and responses were attenuated in calcium-free solution.  We conclude that calcium channel function and its regulation by protein kinase C contribute to altered vascular reactivity in hypertension.  Further, these abnormalities have a pressure dependency, because they did not occur in abdominal aortae from coarcted rats.",13
"Intrathoracic current flow during transthoracic defibrillation in dogs. Transcardiac current fraction.  To achieve transcardiac threshold current during transthoracic defibrillation, a considerably larger current must be delivered to the thorax to compensate for the shunting effect of the lungs, the thoracic cage, and other elements of the torso.  This shunting effect is thus an important determinant of transthoracic defibrillation threshold and can be quantified by the transcardiac current fraction (FC, the ratio of transcardiac to transthoracic threshold currents).  Previous estimates of FC have ranged from as low as 3% to as high as 45%.  The purpose of of this study was to quantify both FC and the major intrathoracic current pathways.  Transthoracic and intrathoracic voltages and currents were simultaneously measured during high-voltage transthoracic shocks in 20 dogs.  With correction factors determined from another set of 12 dogs, these raw data were corrected to compensate for field distortion caused by the presence of the intrathoracic electrodes, and the adjusted data were fit to a resistive network model.  The results showed that 82% of the transthoracic current was shunted by the thoracic cage, while 14% was shunted by the lungs.  The remaining 4% (FC) is the portion that passed through the heart.  There was good agreement between the two independent methods used to calculate FC.  Analysis based on the model indicated that FC was 3.7%, whereas FC determined by direct measurement with calibrated electrodes was 4.2%.  Therefore, the results of this study, in contrast to earlier estimates of FC, show that defibrillation in dogs is achieved by only 4% of the total transthoracic current.",22
"Influence of high-dose aprotinin treatment on blood loss and coagulation patterns in patients undergoing myocardial revascularization.  Intraoperative administration of the proteinase inhibitor aprotinin causes reduction in blood loss and homologous blood requirement in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.  To ascertain the blood-saving effect of aprotinin and to obtain further information about the mode of action, 40 patients undergoing primary myocardial revascularization were randomly assigned to receive either aprotinin or placebo treatment.  Aprotinin was given as a bolus of 2 x 10(6) kallikrein inactivator units (KIU) before surgery followed by a continuous infusion of 5 x 10(5) KIU/h during surgery.  Additionally, 2 x 10(6) KIU were added to the pump prime.  Strict criteria were used to obtain a homogeneous patient selection.  Total blood loss was reduced from 1,431 +/- 760 ml in the control group to 738 +/- 411 ml in the aprotinin group (P less than 0.05) and the homologous blood requirement from 838 +/- 963 ml to 163 +/- 308 ml (P less than 0.05).  In the control group, 2.3 +/- 2.2 U of homologous blood or blood products were given, and in the aprotinin group, 0.63 +/- 0.96 U were given (P less than 0.05).  Twenty-five percent of patients in the control group and 63% in the aprotinin group did not receive banked blood or homologous blood products.  The activated clotting time as an indicator of inhibition of the contact phase of coagulation was significantly increased before heparinization in the aprotinin group (141 +/- 13 s vs.  122 +/- 25 s) and remained significantly increased until heparin was neutralized after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).",22
"Comparison of DNA content in gastric cancer cells between primary lesions and lymph node metastases.  Cytophotomtric DNA contents of tumor cells in primary lesions and the corresponding metastatic lymph nodes were compared in 61 cases of gastric cancer to determine whether the DNA content remains stable during lymph node metastasis.  The DNA distribution patterns were grouped into three types, according to the proportion of aneuploid cell population.  Changes in DNA patterns between primary and metastatic lesions were evident in 36 of 61 patients (59.0%); in the remaining 25 (41.0%), the same DNA distribution patterns were noted for both lesions.  In 33 of these 36, DNA pattern in the primary carcinoma was transformed into a more narrowly scattered one in the metastatic lesion of the lymph node.  Mean and modal values and the frequency of cells over tetraploid (4c) or hexaploid (6c) were significantly higher in the primary lesion compared with findings in the metastatic lesions.  This reduction in DNA content in the metastatic lesions was a more frequent occurrence in differentiated (18 of 23) than in undifferentiated adenocarcinoma (15 of 35) (P less than 0.01).  Therefore, in primary lesions with a widely scattered DNA ploidy, the tumor cells with a smaller DNA ploidy frequently metastasized to lymph nodes, particularly in cases of a differentiated carcinoma.  Such observations may be pertinent in future designing of treatment protocols.",3
"The inwardly pointing knee. An unrecognized problem of external rotational malalignment.  Twelve patients with inwardly pointing knees had chronic knee pain and disability suggestive of patellofemoral subluxation.  None had responded well to conservative measures or surgical correction at the level of the soft tissues.  Their pattern of limb alignment was studied roentgenographically and was found to differ significantly from the control group of 49 healthy young adults.  The deformities primarily related to the tibia were external tibial torsion, excess varus angulation of the tibial plateau, and varus knees.  Angulation of the femoral condyles was normal and femoral anteversion did not appear to contribute significantly to the deformity.  Surgery in seven cases (nine knees) was by derotation valgus Maquet osteotomy of the tibia and lateral release realignment of the patellae.  Outcome assessments after a three-year follow-up period (five knees) were excellent.  Early results on the remaining cases were satisfactory.",4
"Molecular defect of the band 3 protein in southeast Asian ovalocytosis   BACKGROUND.  Southeast Asian ovalocytosis is a form of hereditary elliptocytosis in which the red cells are rigid and resistant to malaria invasion.  The underlying molecular defect is unknown.  METHODS AND RESULTS.  We studied the red cells of 54 patients with ovalocytosis and 122 normal controls.  We found that ovalocytes contain a structurally and functionally abnormal band 3 protein, the principal transmembrane protein of red cells.  The structural lesion of ovalocyte band 3 was revealed by limited proteolytic cleavage of the protein, which produced fragments of abnormal size that were derived from the cytoplasmic domain of the protein.  The structural lesion was present in all the subjects with ovalocytosis but none of the controls.  This region of band 3 serves as the principal binding site for the membrane skeleton, a submembrane protein network composed of ankyrin, spectrin, actin, and protein 4.1.  The structural defect is dominantly inherited, being tightly linked with the inheritance of ovalocytosis (the probability of linkage is in excess of 10 million to 1).  Ovalocyte band 3 bound considerably more tightly than normal band 3 to ankyrin, which connects the membrane skeleton to the band 3 protein.  This tight binding of ovalocyte band 3 to the underlying skeleton containing ankyrin was directly confirmed in intact cells by the finding that ovalocyte band 3 had markedly reduced lateral mobility in the membrane.  CONCLUSIONS.  The red cells in Southeast Asian ovalocytosis carry a structurally and functionally abnormal band 3 protein.  This molecular defect may underlie the increased rigidity of the red cells and their resistance to invasion by malaria parasites.",14
"Maternal hemodynamics in normal and preeclamptic pregnancies: a longitudinal study   Preeclampsia is a disease unique to pregnancy that contributes substantially to maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality.  The condition has been thought to be one of hypoperfusion in which increased vascular resistance characterizes the associated hypertension.  This study was designed to test an alternative hypothesis, that preeclampsia is characterized by high cardiac output.  In a blinded longitudinal study of nulliparas with uncomplicated pregnancies, cardiac output was measured serially by Doppler technique.  Cardiac output was elevated throughout pregnancy in patients who became preeclamptic (P = .006).  Six weeks postpartum, the hypertension of the preeclamptic subjects had resolved but cardiac output remained elevated (P = .001) and peripheral resistance remained lower than in the normotensive subjects (P = .001).  This study demonstrates that preeclampsia is not a disease of systemic hypoperfusion and challenges most current models of the disease based on that assumption.",12
"Adjuvant chemotherapy of breast cancer.  Many women will not be cured of breast cancer by even the best early detection and surgical techniques because of micrometastases present at diagnosis.  Adjuvant therapy has extended the disease-free interval for most patients and lengthens overall survival for many.  Combination chemotherapy has become the standard form of adjuvant treatment for premenopausal women with breast cancer and positive lymph nodes after primary therapy.  With minimal toxicity, disease-free and overall survival are improved.  Results are less impressive or less clear-cut for postmenopausal women or any woman with negative lymph nodes.  Long-term toxicities of adjuvant chemotherapy may include second malignancies and cardiac dysfunction.  Although these complications probably are rare, they must be considered seriously when weighing chemotherapy for patients in whom its benefits may be slight.  Innovations likely to become standard in adjuvant therapy decision making include risk assessment with new prognostic indicators (growth fraction, oncogene expression) and investigation of dose intensification using bone marrow growth factors and autologous stem-cell support.",3
"Anti-(U1) small nuclear RNA antibodies in anti-small nuclear ribonucleoprotein sera from patients with connective tissue diseases.  Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) particles are a class of RNA-containing particles in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells.  Sera from patients with connective tissue diseases often contain antibodies against the proteins present in these snRNPs.  Antibodies against the RNA components of snRNPs, the U snRNAs, are thought to be rare.  We tested 118 anti-snRNP sera for the presence of anti-snRNA antibodies and found them in 45 sera (38%).  In all sera the antibodies (IgG and F(ab)2 fragments thereof) were exclusively directed against U1 snRNA.  The anti-(U1) RNA antibodies were always accompanied by anti-(U1)RNP antibodies but were not found in sera which contain antibodies of the Sm serotype directed against all nucleoplasmic U snRNP particles.  Like anti-RNP antibodies, anti-U1 RNA activity is confined to sera from patients with SLE or SLE overlap syndromes and is rarely found in patients with other connective tissue diseases.  By analyzing binding to subfragments of U1 snRNA made in vitro, it was demonstrated that anti-(U1)RNA antibodies recognize epitopes distributed throughout the U1 RNA molecule.  In most sera, however, either the second or the fourth hairpin loop is the main target of the antibody.  The possible mechanisms that could lead to the production of this new type of autoantibody are discussed.",16
"From the parallel group design to the crossover design, and from the group approach to the individual approach.  The consequences of heterogeneity in response to antihypertensive drugs for the clinical development programs of new antihypertensive drugs and for the care of the individual hypertensive patient have not previously been sufficiently recognized.  They play a role in the inappropriate choice of too-high daily doses of some antihypertensive drugs at the end of extensive international development programs.  They are also implicated in the insufficient control of blood pressure observed in the long-term multicenter trials in hypertension, where some patients have been treated for several years with drugs that were not the most appropriate for their disease and which did not adequately control their blood pressure.  In addition to the parallel group studies, the use of double-blind two-period or multiple period crossover designs can provide valid data for the dose-finding of new antihypertensive drugs and their comparative evaluation.  At the end of the trial, these designs also offer each patient the opportunity to be treated with the right dose of the drug most appropriate for his or her disease.",13
"Cemented and ingrowth fixation of the Miller-Galante prosthesis. Clinical and roentgenographic comparison after three- to six-year follow-up studies.  One hundred thirty-nine cemented and 132 cementless Miller-Galante total knee prostheses were followed between three and six years (average, 43-44 months).  The fixation technique was based on patient age, bone quality, and ability to delay full-weight bearing.  Clinical follow-up studies were possible on 116 cemented knees.  Fifteen knees were lost because of death before the three-year follow-up study, and eight knees required component removal.  One hundred twenty-three cementless knees were available for clinical follow-up studies; there were three deaths, and six failures required component removal.  No cemented failure was due to fixation, and three cementless failures were due to lack of tibial ingrowth in two and pain of undetermined etiology in one.  Preoperative knee scores were slightly significant with cemented knees averaging 48 points and cementless knees averaging 52 points.  A similar significant difference was maintained at the final follow-up study.  No significant differences were noted for pain, limp, or support scores.  Average range of motion was similar in the two groups.  Radiolucent lines about the femoral component were rare.  Cementless tibial radiolucencies were partial in up to 20% of examined zones, and complete tibial tray radiolucency was seen in only three patients.  No correlation between radiolucency and knee scores was seen.",9
"The temporomandibular joint in rheumatoid arthritis. Correlations between clinical and computed tomography features.  Clinical and computed tomography (CT) examination of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) was performed in 26 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 26 control subjects.  Each examination was scored.  In the group with RA 61.2% had physical signs in the stomatognathic system compared to 42.3% in a control group (NS); 88.4% of the group with RA had erosive or cystic lesions of the TMJ compared to 57.6% of control subjects (p less than 0.05).  The clinical dysfunction score did not correlate with the CT TMJ score in RA.  It correlated with the number of slow acting antirheumatic drugs used, the rheumatoid factor titer and radiographic scores of the hands and cervical spine.  In agreement with others, we believe that the only specific CT lesions of RA are erosions and cysts of the mandibular condyle, that there is no correlation between clinical and CT findings of TMJ in RA, and that the intensity of destructive lesions of TMJ on CT in RA is well correlated with the severity of the disease.",16
"The reversibility of canine vein-graft arterialization.  We assessed the reversibility of functional and morphological changes of arterialized vein segments by returning them to the venous circulation.  Thirteen dogs underwent right carotid and femoral veno-arterial grafting.  After 12 weeks, veno-arterial grafts were removed for contractility (norepinephrine [NE] and 5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]), luminal prostacyclin (PGI2), and morphometric analyses; the remaining segments were used as left jugular and femoral veno-venous grafts.  After another 12 weeks, the veno-venous grafts were harvested.  To NE, veno-arterial grafts (ED50, 5.4 +/- 0.1 [-log M]) were less sensitive than control veins (ED50, 6.0 +/- 0.2) or veno-venous grafts (ED50, 6.4 +/- 0.2) but were more sensitive than control arteries (ED50, 4.0 +/- 0.1); the maximum tension of veno-arterial grafts (6.2 +/- 0.6 g) was greater than that of veins, less than that of arteries (9.8 +/- 1.0 g), and comparable with that of veno-venous grafts (5.1 +/- 1.1 g).  To 5-HT, veno-arterial (ED50, 7.5 +/- 0.1) and veno-venous (ED50, 7.3 +/- 0.2) grafts were more sensitive than arteries (ED50, 6.0 +/- 0.3), while the vein was unresponsive; the maximum tension of veno-arterial grafts (5.0 +/- 0.7 g) was less than that of arteries (6.9 +/- 0.9 g) and greater than that of veno-venous grafts (1.4 +/- 0.3 g).  PGI2 production in veins (3.6 +/- 0.8 ng/ml), veno-arterial grafts (3.9 +/- 0.8 ng/ml), and veno-venous grafts (3.3 +/- 0.9 ng/ml) was comparable and less than that of arteries (6.4 +/- 0.9 ng/ml).  Veno-arterial graft intimal thickness (127 +/- 8 microns) and intimal area (15.6 +/- 1.8 x 10(3) microns 2) tended to be greater than that in the veno-venous graft (113 +/- 9 microns and 12.4 +/- 1.8 x 10(3) microns 2); also, the veno-arterial graft medial area (103.0 +/- 7.3 x 10(3) microns 2) was greater than that of the veno-venous graft (80.3 +/- 6.9 x 10(3) microns 2), thereby resulting in a similar relative intimal area (13 +/- 1%).  Therefore, some changes associated with arterialization, for example, adrenergic sensitivity, maximum tension to 5-HT, medial thickening, and perhaps intimal hyperplasia, reverted toward venous values when replaced in the venous environment, possibly due to variations in pressure, flow, shear stress, and/or graft preparation techniques.  Luminal PGI2 was unchanged in the grafts, implying that graft contractility was not modulated by luminal PGI2.",22
"Should safety concerns with available ulcer treatment influence drug selection?  With the identification of the parietal cell receptors for gastric acid secretion coupled with the introduction of cimetidine in 1977, treatment of acid-peptic diseases was transformed from empiric therapy to an approach based on a clearer understanding of human physiology.  Today, physicians are confronted with an array of antiulcer agents that differ within their drug class (e.g., the H2-receptor antagonists) as well as in their mechanisms of action (e.g., neutralize acid, alter mucosal defensive factors, or suppress acid secretion).  With minor exceptions, the clinical efficacy of the available antiulcer drugs can be regarded as comparable.  Thus, the safety profile becomes the next consideration when choosing among similarly effective drug products.  Of the available antiulcer agents, the H2-receptor antagonists as a class have an excellent safety profile, as indicated by more than 25 years of cumulative clinical experience and postmarketing surveillance.  Important safety issues with currently available antiulcer drugs, i.e., H2-receptor antagonists, sucralfate, prostaglandin E analogues, and the newest antiulcer agent, omeprazole, are reviewed to place them into perspective for the clinician.",5
"Estrogen replacement and coronary artery disease. Effect on survival in postmenopausal women.  The relationship among postmenopausal estrogen use, coronary stenosis, and survival was examined retrospectively in 2268 women undergoing coronary angiography.  The patients were selected for study if their age was 55 years or older at the time of angiography or if they had previously undergone bilateral oophorectomy.  Postmenopausal estrogen use in 1178 patients with coronary artery disease (greater than 70% stenosis) and 644 patients with mild to moderate coronary artery disease (5% to 69% stenosis) was compared with 446 control subjects (0% stenosis) using life-table analysis.  Over 10 years of follow-up, there was no significant difference in survival among patients initially free of coronary lesions on arteriography who had either never used (377) or ever used (69) estrogens.  Among patients with mild to moderate coronary stenosis, 10-year survival of those who had never used estrogens was 85.0% and it was 95.6% among 99 ""ever users."" Survival was 60.0% among those with more than 70% coronary stenosis who had never used estrogen and it was 97.0% among 70 ever users.  The ""never users"" group were older (65 vs 59 years), had a lower proportion of cigarette smokers (40% vs 57.1%), a higher proportion of subjects with diabetes (21.7% vs 12.9%) and hyperlipidemia (58% vs 44%), and approximately equal numbers of hypertensives (56.0% vs 54.3%).  Cox's proportional hazards model was used to estimate survival as a function of multiple covariables.  Estrogen use was found to have a significant, independent effect on survival in women.  We conclude that estrogen replacement after menopause prolongs survival when coronary artery disease is present, but it has less effect in the absence of coronary artery disease.",13
"Isolated avulsion of the biceps femoris insertion. A case report.  The clinical, roentgenographic, and operative findings of an isolated biceps femoris avulsion in a 21-year-old man demonstrated the significance of the static stabilizers about the knee, menisci, and articular cartilage.  Examination of the dynamic structures about the knee, however, may present a diagnostic problem.  A systematic examination of the musculature (hamstrings, quadriceps, and patellofemoral mechanism) should be included in the evaluation of every acute knee injury.  Special attention should be given to the surface anatomy as well as function of the knee.",20
"Human basophils express interleukin-4 receptors.  Interleukin-4 (IL-4), a multipotential lymphokine reputed to play an important role in the regulation of immune responses, interacts with a variety of hemopoietic target cells through specific cell surface membrane receptors.  The present study was designed to investigate whether human basophils express IL-4 binding sites.  For this purpose, basophils were enriched to homogeneity (93% and 98% purity, respectively) from the peripheral blood of two chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL) donors using a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) and complement.  Purified basophils bound 125I-radiolabeled recombinant human (rh) IL-4 in a specific manner.  Quantitative binding studies and Scatchard plot analysis revealed the presence of a single class of high affinity IL-4 binding sites (280 +/- 40 sites per cell in donor 1 and 640 +/- 45 sites per cell in donor 2) with an apparent dissociation constant, kd, of 7.12 x 10(-11) +/- 2.29 x 10(-11) and 9.55 +/- 3.5 x 10(-11) mol/L, respectively.  KU812-F, a human basophil precursor cell line, was found to express a single class of 810 to 1,500 high affinity IL-4 binding sites with a kd of 2.63 to 5.54 x 10(-10) mol/L.  No change in the numbers or binding constants of IL-4 receptors was found after exposure of KU812-F cells to rhIL-3 (a potent activator of basophils) for 60 minutes.  No effect of rhIL-4 on 3H-thymidine uptake, release or synthesis of histamine, or expression of basophil differentiation antigens (Bsp-1, CD11b, CD25, CD40, CD54) on primary human CGL basophils or KU812-F cells was observed.",3
"Treatment of advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the skin with cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and bleomycin.  The authors treated 14 patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin or lip with one to four cycles of combination chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin by bolus injection, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and bleomycin by continuous 5-day infusion.  Objective responses were seen in 11 of the 13 evaluable patients (84%).  Four patients had a complete remission (30%) and seven patients, a partial remission (54%).  Local control after definitive complementary radiation and/or surgical treatment was achieved in seven patients.  Toxic side effects was acceptable; they consisted of nausea and vomiting in all patients, transient skin changes, hematologic (Grade 3/4) abnormalities in four patients, and pulmonary fibrosis in one elderly patient.  These results show that this chemotherapy combination could play a role in reducing the tumor mass and in facilitating definitive treatment to obtain better functional and cosmetic results in advanced SCC of the skin.",3
"Development of IDDM after donating kidney to diabetic sibling.  The goal of this study was to describe a patient who developed insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) after donating a kidney to his sibling and to suggest a possible solution to prevent such an occurrence.  A 42-yr-old man was found to have islet cell autoantibodies (ICAs) as part of a screening program of first-degree relatives with IDDM.  Two years previously, he had donated his kidney to his HLA-identical sibling with long-standing IDDM.  Both oral and intravenous glucose tolerance tests demonstrated a gradual loss of insulin secretion and increasing glucose intolerance until the patient developed IDDM 6 yr after the nephrectomy.  Whether the presence of ICA is an absolute contraindication to being a kidney donor could be debated.  Nonetheless, ICA should be used as a screening test to identify individuals at risk for subsequent IDDM.  For those found to be positive, counseling should be provided.",17
Management of tracheobronchial foreign bodies in children: an update.  Tracheobronchial foreign bodies continue to be a source of morbidity and mortality in the pediatric population.  Technical advances in anesthesia and equipment have made the removal of these troublesome objects more feasible.  Diligence must still be exercised and a coordinated team effort must be employed in order to achieve a satisfactory and safe outcome for the patient.  The appropriate use of diagnostic studies and management techniques are discussed.,20
"585 nm for the treatment of port-wine stains.  Although the flashlamp-pulsed-dye laser has been successfully used for the treatment of port-wine stains (PWS) at 577 nm, a number of adult patients had incomplete clearance of their birthmarks with this treatment modality because of residual vessels lying beyond the 0.75-mm penetration depth of 577-nm irradiation.  Fifteen adult patients, of whom nine were previously treated with limited success at 577 nm (group A), and six untreated patients (group B) were included in the study.  For the group A patients, treatment with 585 nm produced successful clearance of the birthmark.  For the six patients in group B, parallel treatment of different sites of the same lesion coupled with skin biopsies and histologic examination revealed that a change in the wavelength from 577 to 585 nm allowed the laser light to penetrate from the midreticular dermis into the subcutaneous fat.  This explained the clearance achieved at 585 nm and not at 577 nm.",3
"Relief of injection pain in adults. EMLA cream for 5 minutes before venepuncture.  The effectiveness of skin anaesthesia after 5 minutes' topical application of a lignocaine-prilocaine cream was evaluated.  One hundred and twenty patients estimated the pain of antecubital venepuncture both on a linear scale and verbally after use of the cream for either 5 or 60 minutes, a placebo cream or no treatment.  Reported pain was significantly less after only 5 minutes of the lignocaine-prilocaine cream (p = 0.002).  The cream can be used to relieve the pain of all routine injections.",9
"Effects of nonparticipation in trauma center system on emergency department utilization.  The University of Illinois Hospital (UIH) serves an inner-city urban population in one of the highest crime rate districts in Chicago.  On May 20, 1986, the city's Level I Trauma ordinance took effect with the University of Illinois Hospital declining to participate.  To measure the impact of the ordinance on a nonparticipating hospital, we undertook a retrospective analysis of our trauma patient utilization statistics.  Consecutive monthly patient census data of 71 months was compiled with emphasis on patient presenting complaints and related subspecialty evaluation.  We observed significant decreases of patients presenting with head injuries, fractures, and animal bites as well as with major trauma, minor trauma, and general surgery hospital admission.  The final disposition of the patients arriving by ambulance was consistent with the observed decrease in major traumatic conditions and in minor traumatic conditions.  However, the mean number of patient presentations per day (ppd) admitted to regular medical or surgical beds decreased from 2.70 ppd to 2.30 ppd while the mean number of ppd sent home increased from 2.64 ppd to 3.49 ppd.  These data suggest that loss of trauma center status designation has a profound effect on utilization of emergency departments not participating in the trauma system.  Nonparticipation appears to be associated with a significant decrease in utilization rates for major and minor trauma patients and a significant increase in the number of patients discharged who had arrived by the Chicago Fire Department Paramedic System (CFD).  This effect on the emergency department extends to utilization of inpatient services.",20
"Cerebral effects of sevoflurane in the dog: comparison with isoflurane and enflurane.  The cerebral effects of sevoflurane were compared in dogs with those of enflurane and isoflurane.  Initially, the minimum alveolar concentrations (MAC) of sevoflurane and enflurane were determined and the electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to increasing doses of sevoflurane (1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 MAC) or enflurane (1.5 and 2.0 MAC) in unparalysed animals were examined.  Administration of sevoflurane was not associated with seizure activity at any concentration either during normocapnia (PaCO2 5.3 kPa) or hypocapnia (PaCO2 2.7 kPa), even in the presence of intense auditory stimuli.  All dogs anaesthetized with enflurane demonstrated sustained EEG and motor evidence of seizure activity induced by auditory stimuli at concentrations of enflurane greater than 1 MAC, particularly during hypocapnia.  In a separate group of dogs, the effects of increasing concentrations of sevoflurane and isoflurane (0.5, 1.5 and 2.15 MAC) were compared directly on arterial pressure, cardiac output and heart rate, cerebral blood flow and the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2) using the venous outflow technique.  Sevoflurane, in common with isoflurane, had minimal effects on cerebral blood flow at the concentrations studied, but significantly reduced the CMRO2 at end-tidal concentrations sufficient to produce a burst suppression pattern on the EEG (approximately 2.15 MAC).  Both sevoflurane and isoflurane significantly decreased arterial pressure in a dose-dependent manner, but neither drug significantly altered cardiac output.",9
"Reporting of occupational injury and illness in the semiconductor manufacturing industry.  In the United States, occupational illness and injury cases meeting specific reporting criteria are recorded on company Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 200 logs; case description data are submitted to participating state agencies for coding and entry in the national Supplementary Data System (SDS).  We evaluated completeness of reporting (the percentage of reportable cases that were recorded in the company OSHA 200 log) in the semiconductor manufacturing industry by reviewing company health clinic records for 1984 of 10 manufacturing sites of member companies of a national semiconductor manufacturing industry trade association.  Of 416 randomly selected work-related cases, 101 met OSHA reporting criteria.  Reporting completeness was 60 percent and was lowest for occupational illnesses (44 percent).  Case-description data from 150 reported cases were submitted twice to state coding personnel to evaluate coding reliability.  Reliability was high (kappa 0.82-0.93) for ""nature,"" ""affected body part,"" ""source,"" and ""type"" variables.  Coding for the SDS appears reliable; reporting completeness may be improved by use of a stepwise approach by company personnel responsible for reporting decisions.",20
"Rapid percutaneous tracheostomy   We describe a new method of performing percutaneous tracheostomy rapidly and safely using a specialized instrument kit.  The technique permits the safe insertion of a full-sized 7.0 (ID) or 7.5 mm (ID) cuffed cannula into the trachea within 1-2 min, through the membranous second intercartilagenous space.  Animal studies have demonstrated a superior healing process compared to that seen after conventional tracheostomy techniques.",22
"Impact of a public cholesterol screening program.  The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) has endorsed physician case finding as the primary method to detect individuals with elevated cholesterol levels.  Despite this recommendation, promotional and for-profit public screening programs have flourished.  We surveyed participants of a mall-based cholesterol screening program 1 year after their screening.  Sixty-four percent of those screened had not previously known their cholesterol levels.  Those who were newly screened were less likely to benefit from this testing than the general public, since they were older (mean age, 55.3 years), more likely to be female (67.4%), and nonsmokers (88%).  Screenees had excellent recall of their cholesterol level (mean absolute reporting error, 0.24 mmol/L [9 mg/dL]) and a good understanding of cholesterol as a coronary heart disease risk.  Those with elevated cholesterol levels reported high distress from screening but no reduction in overall psychosocial well-being and an actual decrease in absenteeism.  Only 53.7% of all who were advised to seek follow-up because of an elevated screening value had done so within the year following the screening program.  However, of those with values greater than 6.2 mmol/L (240 mg/dL), 68% had sought follow-up.  Many of those who participate in public screening programs have been previously tested, fall into low-benefit groups, or fail to comply with recommended follow-up.  We therefore conclude that cholesterol screening programs of the type now commonly offered are unlikely to contribute greatly to the national efforts to further reduce coronary heart disease.",13
"Low bone density is an etiologic factor for stress fractures in athletes.  OBJECTIVE: To determine whether low bone density and other risk factors for osteoporosis are associated with stress fractures in athletes.  DESIGN: Case-control study.  SETTING: Institutional sports injury clinic with primary and secondary care.  PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-five athletes (nineteen women) with scintigraphically confirmed stress fractures matched for sex, age, weight, height, and exercise history with 25 control athletes with no history of bone injury.  MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Bone mineral density measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry was significantly lower in athletes with fractures than in control athletes: In the spine, bone mineral density was 1.01 +/- 0.14 g/cm2 in athletes with fractures and 1.11 +/- 0.13 g/cm2 in control athletes (P = 0.02).  In the femoral neck, it was 0.84 +/- 0.09 g/cm2 in athletes with fractures and 0.90 +/- 0.11 g/cm2 in control athletes (P = 0.005).  It was also significantly lower in the Ward triangle (P = 0.01) and the greater trochanter (P = 0.01).  Eight athletes with fractures and no control athletes had less than 90% of predicted age-related spine density (P = 0.01), and three athletes with fractures had bone mineral densities that were 2 SDs or more below this predicted level.  More athletes with fractures than control athletes had current menstrual irregularity (amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea) (P less than 0.005).  Fewer athletes with fractures were using oral contraceptives (P less than 0.05).  Seven-day diet records indicated similar energy and nutrient intakes, except athletes with fractures had lower calcium intakes (697 +/- 242 mg/d compared with 832 +/- 309 mg/d; P = 0.02).  Dairy product intake was lower in athletes with fractures since leaving high school (P less than 0.05).  The incidence of a family history of osteoporosis was similar in both groups.  CONCLUSIONS: In athletes with similar training habits, those with stress fractures are more likely to have lower bone density, lower dietary calcium intake, current menstrual irregularity, and lower oral contraceptive use.",20
"Failure of T cell receptor-anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody interaction in T cells from marrow recipients to induce increases in intracellular ionized calcium.  There are multiple immune defects in T cells from recipients after bone marrow transplantation (BMT).  This study examines recipient T cells for increases in intracellular ionized calcium concentration [( Ca2+]i) after binding the T cell receptor-CD3 complex with anti-CD3 MAb.  PBL from 10 of 23 short-term recipients (less than 1 yr after BMT) responded poorly (less than 35% of control) to anti-CD3 stimulation and PBL from 9 of 23 had blunted calcium flux responses (35-70% of control).  Purified CD2+, CD56- cells from seven additional short-term recipients including three autologous marrow recipients were closely examined, and a sizable proportion of CD3+ cells from six of seven recipients did not increase [Ca2+]i after anti-CD3 stimulation.  The decreased magnitude of the responses was due to decreased numbers of responding cells and not to a decrease in mean CD3 fluorescent intensity or in calcium flux responses on a single cell basis.  Five of seven long-term recipients (greater than 1 yr after BMT) had PBL that responded normally and two of seven had PBL with blunted calcium flux responses.  The data show that the signal transduction response mediated by the CD3-antigen receptor as measured by calcium flux is defective early after autologus or allogeneic BMT.",19
"Clinical significance of plasminogen activator inhibitor activity in patients with exercise-induced ischemia.  To assess the fibrinolytic system in patients with exercise-induced ischemia and its relation to ischemia and severity of coronary artery disease (CAD), 47 patients with CAD confirmed by results of coronary angiography underwent symptom-limited multistage exercise thallium-201 emission computed tomography.  All patients with CAD had exercise-induced ischemia as assessed from thallium-201 images.  Pre- and peak exercise blood samples from each patient and preexercise blood samples from control subjects were assayed for several fibrinolytic components and were also assayed for plasma adrenaline.  The extent of ischemia was defined as delta visual uptake score (total visual uptake score in delayed images minus total visual uptake score in initial images) and the severity of CAD as the number of diseased vessels.  In the basal condition, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) activity was significantly higher in patients with exercise-induced ischemia as compared to control subjects (p less than 0.01), although there were no significant differences in other fibrinolytic variables between the two groups.  Moreover, PAI activity in the basal condition displayed a significantly positive correlation with the extent of ischemia (r = 0.47, p less than 0.01).  Patients with exercise-induced ischemia were divided into two groups (24 with single-vessel disease and 23 with multivessel disease).  There were no significant differences in coronary risk factors, hemodynamics, or plasma adrenaline levels during exercise between single-vessel and multivessel disease except that delta visual uptake score was significantly higher in multivessel disease (p less than 0.01).",13
"Effects of adenosine on human coronary arterial circulation   Adenosine is a potent vasodilator used extensively to study the coronary circulation of animals.  Its use in humans, however, has been hampered by lack of knowledge about its effects on the human coronary circulation and by concern about its safety.  We investigated in humans the effects of adenosine, administered by intracoronary bolus (2-16 micrograms), intracoronary infusion (10-240 micrograms/min), or intravenous infusion (35-140 micrograms/kg/min) on coronary and systemic hemodynamics and the electrocardiogram.  Coronary blood flow velocity (CBFV) was measured with a 3F coronary Doppler catheter.  The maximal CBFV was determined with intracoronary papaverine (4.5 +/- 0.2.resting CBFV).  In normal left coronary arteries (n = 20), 16-micrograms boluses of adenosine caused coronary hyperemia similar to that caused by papaverine (4.6 +/- 0.7.resting CBFV).  In the right coronary artery (n = 5), 12-micrograms boluses caused maximal hyperemia (4.4 +/- 1.0.resting CBFV).  Intracoronary boluses caused a small, brief decrease in arterial pressure (similar to that caused by papaverine) and no changes in heart rate or in the electrocardiogram.  The duration of hyperemia was much shorter after adenosine than after papaverine administration.  Intracoronary infusions of 80 micrograms/min or more into the left coronary artery (n = 6) also caused maximal hyperemia (4.4 +/- 0.1.resting CBFV), and doses up to 240 micrograms/min caused a minimal decrease in arterial pressure (-6 +/- 2 mm Hg) and no significant change in heart rate or in electrocardiographic variables.  Intravenous infusions in normal patients (n = 25) at 140 micrograms/kg/min caused coronary vasodilation similar to that caused by papaverine in 84% of patients (4.4 +/- 0.9.resting CBFV).  At submaximal infusion rates, however, CBFV often fluctuated widely.  During the 140-micrograms/kg/min infusion, arterial pressure decreased 6 +/- 7 mm Hg, and heart rate increased 24 +/- 14 beats/min.  One patient developed 1 cycle of 2:1 atrioventricular block, but otherwise, the electrocardiogram did not change.  In eight patients with microvascular vasodilator dysfunction (delta CBFV, less than 3.5 peak/resting velocity after a maximally vasodilating dose of intracoronary papaverine), the dose-response characteristics to intracoronary boluses and intravenous infusions of adenosine were similar to those found in normal patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).",13
"Serum levels of anticardiolipin antibodies are pathologically increased after active immunization of patients with recurrent spontaneous abortion.  Although the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to recurrent spontaneous abortion are still not fully understood, treatment schemes based on immunological principles have been advocated in recent years claiming that the production of the so-called blocking factor is being specifically stimulated.  We investigated, retrospectively, whether active immunization can affect the production of immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies.  In a group of untreated recurrent spontaneous abortion patients (n = 9), the range of variation of cardiolipin antibodies, during consecutive controls taken at the same time interval as after immunization, was not statistically significant.  In contrast to this, significant increases of both IgG and IgM antibodies occurred after active immunization with paternal leucocytes in 10 of 15, and in 6 of 15 cases, respectively.  The mean basal and posttransfusion levels were: 7.26 +/- 2.53 and 30.15 +/- 23 U/mL for IgG and 2.26 +/- 1.2 and 6.82 +/- 5.6 U/mL for IgM, respectively.  We conclude that active immunization with human lymphocytes leads to the production of antibodies against cardiolipin.  This effect is exerted on both IgM and IgG antibodies.",12
"Morphological study of cholesterol hepatolithiasis. Report of three cases.  Three cases of pure cholesterol intrahepatic stones are compared morphologically to those of calcium bilirubinate stones.  Cholesterol stones were found in the intrahepatic bile duct of the left lateral lobe in two cases and in both the left lateral and the right posterior lobe in one.  Although the chronic inflammatory reaction and fibrous thickening of bile duct wall were similar in both types of hepatolithiasis, the proliferation of intrahepatic periductal glands and the production of mucin were rather mild, compared to that is the liner containing calcium bilirubinate stones.  Multiple intramural cholesterol calculi and cholesterin granulomas (cholesterin crystals surrounded by foreign-body giant cells) were found within the cystically dilated small bile duct branches and/or conduits of periductal glands.  The calculi and granulomas were characteristic for cholesterol hepatolithiasis.  These findings suggest that the formation of the cholesterol stones differs from that of calcium bilirubinate stones; the perturbation of factors influencing cholesterol nucleation in the hepatic bile may be related to the changed microenvironment of the intrahepatic bile ducts, which is followed by the formation of cholesterol stones.",5
"Recent progress in understanding apolipoprotein B.  For the past 5 years, investigators from many different laboratories have contributed to a greatly increased understanding of two very important lipid-carrying proteins in plasma--apo B-100 and apo B-48.  Apo B-100, an extremely large protein composed of 4,536 amino acids, is synthesized by the liver and is crucial for the assembly of triglyceride-rich VLDL particles.  Apo B-100 is virtually the only protein of LDL, a cholesteryl ester-enriched class of lipoproteins that are metabolic products of VLDL.  The apo B-100 of LDL serves as a ligand for the LDL receptor-mediated uptake of LDL particles by the liver and extrahepatic tissues.  The LDL receptor-binding region of apo B-100 is located in the carboxyterminal portion of the molecule, whereas its lipid-binding regions appear to be broadly dispersed throughout its length.  Apo B-48 contains the amino-terminal 2,152 amino acids of apo B-100 and is produced by the intestine as a result of editing of a single nucleotide of the apo B mRNA, which changes the codon specifying apo B-100 amino acid 2,153 to a premature stop codon.  Apo B-48 has an obligatory structural role in the formation of chylomicrons; therefore, its synthesis is essential for absorption of dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins.  Both apo B-48 and apo B-100 are encoded on chromosome 2 by a single gene that contains 29 exons and 28 introns.  An elevated level of apo B-100 in the plasma is a potent risk factor for developing premature atherosclerotic disease.  In the past 3 years, many different apo B gene mutations that affect the concentrations of both apo B and cholesterol in the plasma have been characterized.  A missense mutation in the codon for apo B-100 amino aid 3,500 is associated with hypercholesterolemia.  This mutation results in poor binding of apo B-100 to the LDL receptor, thereby causing the cholesteryl ester-enriched LDL particles to accumulate in the plasma.  This disorder is called familial defective apo B-100, and it is probably a cause of premature atherosclerotic disease.  Familial hypobetalipoproteinemia is a condition associated with abnormally low levels of apo B and cholesterol; affected individuals may actually have a reduced risk of atherosclerotic disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).",17
Bipolar versus total hip arthroplasty for avascular necrosis of the femoral head. A comparison.  In a relatively small series of cases the results of bipolar prostheses in avascular necrosis were inferior to those of total hip arthroplasty (THA).  Femoral loosening rates were not reduced by using bipolar prostheses.  THA produced more inferior results in avascular necrosis than in degenerative joint disease.  Early results of noncemented THA for avascular necrosis were good but also must withstand the test of time.  A fixed noncemented acetabular component was preferable over a bipolar prosthesis for avascular necrosis of the femoral head.,4
"Factors determining success and energy requirements for cardioversion of atrial fibrillation.  Factors thought to affect the success of and energy requirements for cardioversion of atrial fibrillation were studied in 80 (49 male, 31 female) patients aged 21-88 (mean 61.5 years).  Transthoracic impedance was measured in advance of the countershock using a 30 kHz low amplitude AC current passed through self-adhesive ECG/defibrillator pads (diameters 8-12 cm) applied to the chest in the antero-posterior (AP) position in 57 patients and the anteroapical (AA) position in 23 patients.  Mean transthoracic impedance for all patients was 69.3 +/- 16 (SD) ohms (range 39-131 ohms), but transthoracic impedance was significantly greater in the AA than the AP position (75.4 +/- 13 vs.  66.7 +/- 16 ohms, p = 0.02).  Initial energy was 50 J (delivered) and was gradually increased to a maximum of 360 J if required.  Cardioversion was successful in 73 of 80 (91.2 per cent), and low energy shocks (less than or equal to 200 J) were successful in 45 of 80 (56.2 per cent) patients.  Using single factor analysis, sex, left atrial enlargement, electrode pad positions, aetiology of atrial fibrillation, presence of left ventricular failure, and prior treatment with verapamil or beta-adrenergic blockers were not significant determinants of cardioversion success or success of low energy shocks but prior treatment with digoxin was, both for cardioversion success and success at low energies.  In patients with transthoracic impedance less than or equal to 70 ohms, low energy shocks were more often successful (33 or 50, 66 per cent) than in patients with transthoracic impedance greater than 70 ohms (12 of 30, 40 per cent), p = 0.04.  Using univariate analysis, cardioversion success with low energy shocks was not only significantly associated with prior treatment with digoxin but also with the duration of atrial fibrillation (24 hours to one month and one month to three years) and for shocks of less than or equal to 100 J, with prior treatment with amiodarone.  Multifactorial linear regression analysis selected, in rank order, only duration of atrial fibrillation of 24 hours to less than one month and one month to three years as significant predictors of both cardioversion success irrespective of shock strength, and success of low energy shocks.",13
"Insulin-like growth factor-I supports proliferation of autocrine thymic lymphoma cells with a pre-T cell phenotype.  We have studied the phenotypic characteristics and growth properties of murine T lymphoma cell lines derived from primary x-ray-induced thymic lymphomas at the earliest stage at which they can be detected, and well before spreading to other organs has occurred.  These cell lines serve as model systems for the earliest events in T cell lymphoma induction, before tumor cell progression and spreading to other organs.  We find that primary x-ray-induced T cell lymphoma lines have phenotypic characteristics of thymic pre-T cells and show no proliferative response to any of the IL tested nor to other hematopoietic growth factors.  However, they do proliferate in response to insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and to a small autocrine peptide distinct from IGF-I, which we term lymphoma growth factor.  One of the earliest lesions in T cell lymphoma induction may therefore be an inhibition of differentiation at one of several specific points.  In its early stages, T lymphoma cell growth may be restricted to an environment where local concentrations of specific growth factors such as IGF-I or lymphoma growth factor are sufficiently high.",3
"Glucocorticoids inhibit neurogenic plasma extravasation and prevent virus-potentiated extravasation in the rat trachea.  Capsaicin increases the permeability of blood vessels in the rat tracheal mucosa through a mechanism involving the release of tachykinins from sensory nerves.  This capsaicin-induced increase in vascular permeability is potentiated by viral infections of the respiratory tract.  The present study was done to determine whether this ""neurogenic plasma extravasation"" can be inhibited by glucocorticoids, to learn the time course of this inhibition, and to determine whether glucocorticoids can prevent the potentiating effect of viral respiratory infections on neurogenic plasma extravasation.  Groups of pathogen-free F344 rats were treated with dexamethasone for 2 or 8 h (4 mg/kg i.p.) or 48 or 120 h (0.5-4 mg/kg per d i.p.).  Another group of rats was treated with dexamethasone for 120 h following the intranasal inoculation of Sendai virus.  The magnitude of plasma extravasation produced by capsaicin or substance P was assessed after this treatment by using Monastral blue pigment and Evans blue dye as intravascular tracers.  We found that dexamethasone reduced, in a dose-dependent fashion, the magnitude of plasma extravasation produced in the rat trachea by capsaicin and substance P.  Significant inhibition was produced by a dose of dexamethasone as small as 0.5 mg/kg i.p.  The effect of dexamethasone had a latency of several hours and reached a maximum after 2 d of treatment.  Furthermore, dexamethasone prevented the potentiation of neurogenic plasma extravasation usually present after 5 d of Sendai virus respiratory infection.",7
Open transpedicular biopsy of the vertebral body.  We describe a method of obtaining a biopsy from the body of a vertebra by an open transpedicular route.  This minimises the danger of contamination of tissue planes and spaces.,4
"Possible significance of cilioretinal arteries in low-tension glaucoma.  Cilioretinal arteries arise from the short posterior ciliary artery circulation or directly from the choroidal circulation.  The presence of a cilioretinal artery may in compromised discs steal flow from the peripapillary circulation and account for worsening glaucoma damage.  We reviewed the records of 33 patients with unilateral cilioretinal arteries admitted for investigation of low-tension glaucoma.  We looked for absolute difference between the affected and unaffected eyes as well as percent difference relative to the mean value for the two eyes and to the value for the unaffected eye in the following variables: mean defect, corrected loss variance or corrected pattern standard deviation, and adjusted neuroretinal rim area.  No statistically significant differences were found.  The mean disc area for the eyes with cilioretinal arteries was significantly larger than that previously reported for normal eyes.  The results suggest that if vascular steal exists because of the presence of this artery, it is not of major clinical importance.",10
"Selective induction of toxicity to human cells expressing human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat by a conditionally cytotoxic adenovirus vector.  The human immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs) primarily infect CD4+ T lymphocytes, leading eventually to the development of a systemic immune dysfunction termed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).  An attractive strategy to combat HIV-mediated pathogenesis would be to eliminate the initial pool of infected cells and thus prevent disease progression.  We have engineered a replication-defective, conditionally cytotoxic adenovirus vector, Ad-tk, whose action is dependent on the targeted expression of the herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase gene (tk), cloned downstream of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat, in human cells expressing the HIV-1 transcriptional activator Tat.  Infection of Tat-expressing human HeLa or Jurkat cells with Ad-tk resulted in high-level tk expression, which was not deleterious to the viability of these cells.  However, in the presence of the antiherpetic nucleoside analog ganciclovir, Ad-tk infection resulted in a massive reduction in the viability of these Tat-expressing cell lines.  As adenoviruses are natural passengers of the human lymphoid system, our results suggest adenovirus vector-based strategies for the targeted expression, under the control of cis-responsive HIV regulatory elements, of cytotoxic agents in HIV-infected cells for the therapy of HIV-mediated pathogenesis.",19
"Effects of calcium antagonists on renal hemodynamics.  Recent attention has been focused on the effects of calcium antagonists on renal function.  When administered in vitro to the isolated perfused kidney, calcium antagonists exhibit consistent actions permitting characterization of actions permitting characterization of their renal effects.  Calcium antagonists do not affect the vasodilated isolated perfused kidney, but they do markedly alter the response of the kidney to vasoconstrictor agents.  In the presence of norepinephrine, calcium antagonists markedly augment the glomerular filtration rate but produce only a modest improvement in renal perfusion.  Studies using the isolated perfused hydronephrotic rat kidney model, which permits direct visualization of afferent and efferent arterioles, have demonstrated that the augmentation of the glomerular filtration rate is attributable to a preferential vasodilation of preglomerular vessels.  Although the clinical implications of such observations are not fully delineated, preliminary studies in experimental animal models indicate that calcium antagonists might exert salutary effects on renal function in clinical settings characterized by an acute impairment of renal hemodynamics.  It is apparent, however, that the renal hemodynamic effects of calcium antagonists commend their use in the management of essential hypertension.",11
"Health locus of control beliefs and alcohol-related factors that may influence treatment outcomes.  Treatment programs have based their treatment approach on the premise that alcoholics should exert internal control over situations and events that affect them.  Since chronic alcohol use affects the health of an individual, Walston and Walston's Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale was administered to 47 alcoholics in a treatment program.  The population reflected a higher belief that health status is more under their own control than under the control of chance or powerful others.  However, the results indicated that recovering alcoholics with a more powerful other health orientation tended to maintain membership longer with Alcoholics Anonymous, would seek help sooner, would begin heavy drinking at a later age, and would attempt formal treatment more often.",20
"Overall mortality and cancer mortality around French nuclear sites   Higher than expected mortality from leukaemia has been observed in the population under age 25 living around Sellafield and Dounreay, nuclear reprocessing plants in the United Kingdom.  We report the results of a similar study for the population residing around nuclear sites in France.  The number of leukaemia deaths was 58, comparable to the 62 in control areas, and slightly less than the 67 expected from national mortality statistics.  Twelve deaths due to Hodgkin's disease were observed around nuclear sites; this is about twice the number of Hodgkin's deaths observed in control areas and twice the number expected from national mortality statistics.  This observation must, however, be interpreted in light of the fact that several causes of deaths were studied, increasing the play of chance.",3
"A phenomenological interpretation of the variation in dialysate volume with dwell time in CAPD.  Intraperitoneal fluid volume (IPV) changes versus time were followed in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) using a simple volume recovery method.  In each patient dialysates containing 1.36 and 3.86 percent glucose as an osmotic agent were investigated.  The patients' IPV versus time data were fitted to a function determined by four ""arbitrary"" coefficients, from which both the initial ultrafiltration (UF) rate immediately following intraperitoneal (i.p.) fluid instillation and the ""final"" peritoneal-to-blood fluid absorption rate could be assessed.  The peritoneal osmotic conductance to glucose, that is, the peritoneal ultrafiltration coefficient (Kf), times the peritoneal osmotic reflection coefficient to glucose (sigma g), Kf sigma g, was determined using two related approaches.  Kf sigma g is a major determinant of the transperitoneal volume exchange, and it was calculated to be 3.54 +/- 0.85 (+/- SE) and 3.81 +/- 0.52 microliters/min/mm Hg, respectively, depending on the assumption employed.  Kf sigma g was further analysed according to a three-pore model of membrane permeability to determine the possible range of Kf and sigma g compatible with a peritoneal small solute sieving coefficient (phi) ranging from 0.3 to 0.61.  According to these calculations both Kf and sigma g ranged from 0.043 to 0.081 (ml/min/mm Hg and dimensionless, respectively).  The maximal peritoneal lymph flow (L) realistic according to this analysis, and compatible with a measured total peritoneal-to-blood fluid absorption rate of 1.25 +/- 0.14 ml/min, was 0.75 ml/min, the most plausible values, however, falling between 0.3 to 0.5 ml/min.",11
"Role of two types of glucose transporters in enlarged adipocytes from aged obese rats.  The mechanism of insulin-resistant glucose-transport activity in enlarged aged adipocytes was examined.  Glucose-transport activity was assessed by measuring 3-O-methylglucose transport and the concentration of HepG2 erythrocyte/glucose transporter (GLUT1), and the muscle/adipose tissue transporter (GLUT4) was estimated by immunoblotting.  Basal glucose-transport activity increased 6.3-fold/cell but remained constant per unit cellular surface area due to cell enlargement.  Maximal insulin-stimulated transport activity remained constant per cell but decreased per unit cellular surface area.  On a per protein basis, GLUT1 and GLUT4 from aged rats decreased to approximately 60 and 10% of those from young rats, respectively.  However, when the protein content of each fraction and the recoveries of marker enzymes were used for estimating the amount of transporters in intact adipocytes, the amount of GLUT1 per cell remained relatively constant, whereas that of GLUT4 decreased.  In basal cells from young rats, 31% of the total GLUT1 per cell was located in the plasma membrane, whereas in those from aged rats, 63% was located in the plasma membrane.  Thus, in comparing basal adipocytes from aged rats with those from young rats, GLUT1 per cell in the plasma membrane increased 2.8-fold, but this increase was less than that of transport activity (6.3-fold).  In basal cells from young rats, 8% of the total GLUT4 was located in the plasma membrane, and a 4.5-fold increase was observed with insulin treatment, but the amount of GLUT4 in each fraction from aged rats markedly decreased.",17
"Changes in circulating alphafetoprotein following administration of mifepristone in first trimester pregnancy.  The occurrence of fetomaternal haemorrhage was investigated in 30 women by measuring maternal serum alphafetoprotein (AFP) levels before and after the administration of mifepristone (RU 486) for termination of first trimester pregnancy.  A significant rise in AFP levels was seen in 21 women (70%), the increase ranging from 6 to 660% of baseline levels.  The apparent frequency of fetomaternal haemorrhage was similar to that reported previously for surgical termination of first trimester pregnancies.",15
"The physician's role in injury prevention: beyond the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force report.  Injuries and their prevention have received little attention by the medical community, despite the fact that injuries are the leading cause of premature death.  However, much can be done to reduce the number and severity of injuries, and the practicing physician has an important role to play in this process.  This report outlines the U.S.  Preventive Services Task Force report recommendations for prevention strategies to reduce injuries and then seeks to define a broader role for the physician in prevention injuries that extends beyond the confines of office-based practice.  While screening and counseling have proven effectiveness in certain situations, interventions that are passive or automatic in action, such as air bags, have proven to be more effective long-term solutions to reduce both the number and the severity of injuries.  The author outlines and provides examples of seven areas where physicians can have a major impact either directly or through implementing effective injury-control strategies.  These are: treatment, education, screening, hazard identification, research, advocacy, and policy making.  Using all of these approaches, physicians can play a truly effective role in reducing the burden of injuries for their patients.",20
"Skin conductance and arousal in the newborn.  We measured skin conductance continuously from the sole of a foot in babies of different conceptional ages before, during, and for 10 minutes after a 'heel prick' carried out for routine blood sampling.  We studied 82 healthy babies whose gestational and postnatal ages ranged from 25-42 weeks, and 1-73 days.  The median skin conductance level (preheel prick) in babies of 40-43 weeks' conceptional age was 0.6 microS (microsiemens) and differed significantly between awake babies (1.2 microS) and those who were asleep (0.5 microS).  In contrast babies less than 40 weeks had a significantly lower median skin conductive level (0.3 microS) which was identical in awake and asleep babies.  In response to the heel prick all babies became aroused and skin conductance rose sharply and immediately in 21 out of 22 (95%) babies 40-43 weeks' conceptional age, and in seven out of 23 (30%) babies 36-39 weeks.  The median rise at one minute in babies of 40-43 weeks was significantly higher than those 36-39 weeks (2.7 microS compared with 0.5 microS).  No babies less than 36 weeks had a change in their skin conductance after the heel prick.  These results are consistent with the notion that 'emotional sweating' is a function of maturity and does not develop until 36 weeks' conceptional age.",9
"Mutations in src homology regions 2 and 3 of activated chicken c-src that result in preferential transformation of mouse or chicken cells.  src homology regions 2 and 3 (SH2 and SH3) of proteins encoded by src and closely related genes are conserved domains believed to modulate the protein-tyrosine kinase activity of this class of proteins, perhaps through interactions with other proteins.  To explore the possibility of using src mutants as probes for such interactions, we have compared mouse NIH 3T3 cells with chicken embryo fibroblasts as host cells for 24 previously described substitution and deletion mutants with lesions in the SH2- and SH3-encoding regions of a transformation-competent allele of chicken c-src.  Although several of these mutants are equally competent or equally defective for transformation of the two cell types, four mutants (three of which map within SH3) preferentially transform NIH 3T3 cells, and seven mutants (all of which map within SH2) preferentially transform chicken cells.  Some of the SH2 mutants least able to transform mouse cells exhibit augmented transforming activity in chicken cells.  In general, the in vitro protein-tyrosine kinase activities of the mutants correlated with transforming activities.  Thus, in many cases, the catalytic activity of a mutant protein depended upon the host cell in which the protein was made.  Such host-dependent mutants may be especially useful reagents for biochemical and genetic studies of the src gene family.",22
"Surgical staples in cesarean section: a randomized controlled trial.  This randomized controlled trial compares the use of the Auto Suture Poly CS 57 disposable surgical stapler (n = 98) with standard hysterectomy (n = 102) in low transverse cesarean sections.  Subjective assessment of blood loss by the surgeon resulted in lower mean (+/- SEM) total blood loss estimates in the stapled group (492 +/- 24 ml) than in the nonstapled group (579 +/- 38 ml) (p = 0.05).  However, surgeon's estimation of blood loss as a result of the hysterotomy and blood loss estimated by the hemoglobin deficit measured on the second postoperative day did not significantly differ between the two groups.  The use of the stapling device tended to lengthen the total operating time, which averaged 42.5 minutes in the group with the staples and 39.2 minutes in the group with the standard hysterotomy (p = 0.05).  The risk of febrile morbidity, the frequency of endometritis, and the length of hospitalization were similar in the two groups.  Our results do not support the routine use of the Auto Suture Poly CS 57 disposable surgical stapler in low transverse cesarean sections.",22
"Adult open heart surgery in New York State. An analysis of risk factors and hospital mortality rates   This study analyzes data from New York State's new Cardiac Surgery Reporting System, which contains information about cardiac preoperative risk factors, postoperative complications, and hospital discharge.  The purposes of the study were to determine the set of significant clinical risk factors and to identify cardiac surgical centers most likely to have serious quality-of-care problems.  Significant risk factors for in-hospital death were age, gender, ejection fraction, previous myocardial infarction, number of open heart operations in previous admissions, diabetes requiring medication, dialysis dependence, disasters (acute structural defect, renal failure, cardiogenic shock, gunshot), unstable angina, intractable congestive heart failure, left main trunk narrowed more than 90%, and type of operation performed.  Four of the 28 hospitals had significantly higher mortality rates than expected, given the risk factors of their patients.  Subsequent site visits and medical record reviews confirmed that these facilities had high percentages of quality-of-care problems among cases resulting in mortality.",13
"Buccal cellulitis.  Buccal cellulitis (BC) is an innocuous appearing infection of the cheek that is found in children and has a high incidence of concomitant bacteremia.  Typically, the child is younger than 12 months and has a 2 to 8 hour prodrome of coryza and fever before developing the cellulitis on the cheek.  A purplish hue on the cellulitic region is highly suggestive of Hemophilus influenzae bacteremia.  The differential diagnosis is reviewed.  A complete blood count, blood culture, and cellulitis aspirate culture, should be obtained on all patients with BC.  Meningitis may be present despite the lack of meningeal signs.  A lumbar puncture should be performed on all children at risk for bacteremic BC.  The vast majority of these children are bacteremic and require parenteral antibiotics.  A typical case of BC is presented and its management is reviewed.",0
"Macrophage tropism of HIV-1.  Both in vivo and in vitro studies clearly demonstrate that cells of the mononuclear phagocyte lineage are major hosts for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) replication.  Presumably these cells play a key role in the pathogenesis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).  To further delineate the interactions between HIV-1 and host cells, the susceptibility and permissivity of normal human peripheral blood-derived monocyte/macrophages (M/M) and T lymphocytes, and neoplastic monocytoid and lymphoid cell lines to various HIV-1 isolates was assessed.  The results suggest: (1) ""fresh"" isolates recovered from patients and propagated only in normal host cells exhibit a dual tropism for both M/M and T cells, regardless of their tissue of origin or the cell type from which they were isolated; (2) the repeated passage of an HIV-1 isolate through normal M/M does not generally result in the loss of the ability to infect normal T cells nor vice versa; (3) the majority of fresh HIV-1 isolates do not infect neoplastic cells of either origin, and those that do show no preference for monocytoid or lymphoid targets, regardless of their cell origin.",19
"Effect of serum from patients with minimal to mild endometriosis on mouse embryo development in vitro.  Two-cell mouse embryos were cultured at 37 degrees C in 5% CO2, 95% air with a 7.5% serum supplement from patients with minimal to mild endometriosis, (group I, n = 31), tubal factor (group II, n = 33), male factor (group III, n = 17), fetal cord samples (group IV, n = 37), and Ham's F-10 medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) without a serum supplement (group V, n = 30).  The progression to blastocyst stage (mean percent +/- SE) at 96 hours in groups I, II, III, IV, and V was 29.9% +/- 3.7%, 60.6% +/- 4.9%, 56.2% +/- 5.2%, 61.7% +/- 5.8%, and 63.2% +/- 6.9%, respectively.  Serum factors appear to be associated with an inhibition of early embryogenesis, which may explain the decreased fertility rates observed in patients with minimal to mild endometriosis.",12
"Alternating cisplatinum and VAC ineffective in end stage squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.  Sixteen patients with end stage squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were admitted to a phase II study of alternating courses of cisplatinum (100 mg/m2) and VAC (vincristine 1.4 mg/m2, adriamycin 50 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2) given at three weekly intervals.  Only two patients achieved a response (12 per cent).  The median survival time was 62 days which is much the same as that of a similar group of patients who received no chemotherapy in a previous trial (70 days).",3
"Effect of race upon organ donation and recipient survival in liver transplantation.  The effect of the race of the donor on organ donation and on the outcome of clinical liver transplantation has not been addressed previously.  The aims of this study were to determine: (1) the number of organs donated by each of the major racial groups of the United States, (2) the outcome of transplantation of these organs across racial groups, and (3) the pattern of liver disease that required transplantation in each of these racial groups.  A significantly higher proportion of organs were donated by white non-Hispanic Americans than either black or Hispanic Americans.  There was no significant difference in survival when an organ was transplanted between black and white Americans and vice versa.  Postnecrotic cirrhosis from a variety of causes was the most common indicator affecting black and white recipients, while primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis were uncommon in the black population.  While the number of organs donated by blacks was low, it was, however, proportional to the number of black recipients in this study.  Reasons for the low rate of donation by the black and white Hispanic population are discussed.  It is concluded that race is not a criteria to be used in selection of donors for liver transplantation.  Educational programs addressing issues of organ donation and transplantation directed towards the black and Hispanic populations are recommended.",5
"Prevalence of additional cardiovascular anomalies in patients referred for transcatheter closure of patent ductus arteriosus.  Catheter closure of the patent ductus arteriosus is now a reality.  The purpose of this study was to establish the prevalence of associated cardiovascular defects and the accuracy of echocardiography in patients referred for transvenous ductal closure.  This study reviewed 146 patients seen from 1981 to 1988: 126 with only a patent ductus arteriosus (Group I) and 20 with additional cardiovascular anomalies (Group II).  Groups I and II did not differ significantly in age, gender or physical examination except for the presence of a continuous murmur (Group I 100% versus Group II 80%, p less than 0.001).  A left patent ductus arteriosus was visualized by two-dimensional echocardiography in 96% of patients and was evident by Doppler study in 100%.  A patent ductus arteriosus was not seen in six patients including a patient who was found to have only a collateral network from the aorta to the main pulmonary artery.  The 12 patients with noncardiovascular abnormalities such as Down's syndrome were more likely than the overall group to have additional cardiovascular anomalies (6 of 12, p = 0.001).  The cardiovascular anomalies encountered were varied.  Eight of the 20 patients with such anomalies had only a restrictive ventricular septal defect in addition to the patent ductus arteriosus.  Significant anomalies found at catheterization included two thoracic arteriovenous malformations and an isolated right carotid artery draining into the right pulmonary artery by way of a right ductus arteriosus.  This study indicates that echocardiography is an effective diagnostic technique in this patient group.  A thorough cardiac catheterization with angiography should be performed before implantation of a ductal device.",15
"Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in Bell's palsy.  Inflammation of the facial nerve in Bell's palsy can be demonstrated on gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging.  We have studied a series of 17 Bell's palsy patients with gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, and the purpose of this paper is to report our findings and discuss their significance.  Most acute Bell's palsy cases demonstrate facial nerve enhancement, usually in the distal internal auditory canal and labyrinthine/geniculate segments.  Other segments demonstrate enhancement less often.  Gadolinium enhancement occurs regardless of the severity of the paralysis and can persist after clinical improvement of the paralysis.  The findings of this study corroborate other evidence that the segments of the facial nerve most often involved in Bell's palsy are the only segments that are most often enhanced with gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging.  The role of gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in the management of Bell's palsy patients is discussed.",22
"Sialosyl-Tn. A novel mucin antigen associated with prognosis in colorectal cancer patients.  Colon cancers typically produce mucin.  However, it is not known whether tumor mucin plays a biological role in cancer cell behavior.  To address this issue, the expression of a mucin-associated antigen, sialosyl-Tn, was examined by immunohistochemical study in 128 primary colorectal carcinoma specimens from 137 patients who underwent curative surgical resection.  Antigen expression was correlated with disease-free and overall 5-year survival.  Sialosyl-Tn antigen expression occurred in 112 (87.5%) tumors, and was independent of age, gender, tumor location, Dukes' stage, depth of invasion, degree of differentiation, and ploidy status.  Survival at 5 years for patients with sialosyl-Tn-negative versus sialosyl-Tn-positive tumors was 100% versus 73% (P less than 0.05) and disease-free survival was 94% versus 73%, respectively (P = 0.12).  Although more advanced Dukes' stage, deeper invasion, and aneuploidy were all associated with poorer overall 5-year survival, antigen-negative tumors within each of these groups had much better prognoses than antigen-positive tumors.  Multivariate regression analysis revealed that tumor ploidy (P less than 0.001) and sialosyl-Tn expression (P less than 0.05) were the two variables of most importance for predicting both disease-free and overall survival.  The authors conclude that sialosyl-Tn expression is an independent predictor of poor prognosis in colon cancer, and therefore suggest that qualitative mucin alterations may reflect important differences in the biological behavior of these neoplasms.",3
"Transfer of diabetes in mice prevented by blockade of adhesion-promoting receptor on macrophages.  Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is a disease with an autoimmune aetiology.  The non-obese diabetic mouse is a good spontaneous animal model of the human disease, with IDDM developing in 50-80% of female mice by the age of 6 months.  The disease can be transferred by splenic T cells from diabetic donors and is prevented by T-cell depletion.  The mechanism(s) by which the beta cell is specifically destroyed is not known, but T cells and macrophages have both been implicated, based on the presence of macrophages in the infiltrated islet and the ability of chronic silica treatment to prevent disease.  The monoclonal antibody 5C6 is specific for the myelomonocytic adhesion-promoting type-3 complement receptor (CR3 or CD11b/CD18) and does not bind to T cells.  Here we show that blockade of macrophage CR3 in vivo prevents intra-islet infiltration by both macrophages and T cells and inhibits development of IDDM.  We conclude that both T cells and macrophages have an essential role in the onset of IDDM.",17
"Bilateral simultaneous fractures of the femoral neck: case report.  A case of bilateral fractures of the femoral neck resulting from high-voltage electric injury is reported.  Surgeons caring for patients with electrical injuries must be aware of the possibility of this injury as well as other skeletal injuries which may result from muscle contraction or falls related to electric shock.  Without vigilance for these injuries, diagnosis may be delayed.",20
"Effect of indomethacin on pain relief after thoracotomy.  The effect of indomethacin on postoperative pain was studied in 60 adult patients undergoing thoracotomy in a prospective, randomized, double-blind manner.  Patients receiving indomethacin required significantly less opioid after operation and had significantly lower pain scores compared with the control group.  Pain on movement and on coughing were reduced also.  No major adverse effects were encountered.",22
"Torsade de pointes: a critical care nurse's dilemma.  Torsade de pointes is a polymorphous ventricular tachycardia characterized by a gradual change in the direction of the QRS complex.  Because critical care nurses are the first to recognize arrhythmias, they require the knowledge and skill to intervene appropriately.  This case report focuses on identification of the characteristics, contributing factors, therapeutic modalities, and relevant nursing diagnoses for the patient with torsade de pointes.",13
"Extrahepatic metabolism of morphine occurs in humans.  The pharmacokinetics of morphine was studied in six patients in whom a radiologic localization of an insulinoma was to be performed under general anesthesia.  Sampling was done in the peripheral artery, the mesenteric vein in five of the six patients, the hepatic vein, and the peripheral vein, as well as in urine.  Hepatic blood flow was estimated by an indocyanine green infusion technique at the end of the radiologic procedure.  Morphine terminal half-life was 92 +/- 9 minutes, total body clearance was 1260 ml.min-1, and the hepatic extraction ratio was 0.65 +/- 0.11.  No concentration gradient was observed between the artery and the superior mesenteric vein, showing that no gut wall metabolism of morphine occurred.  The total body clearance exceeded the hepatic clearance by 38%.  It was concluded that the extrahepatic extraintestinal clearance of morphine probably occurred through the kidney.",3
"Retrograde recanalization of an occluded posterior tibial artery by using a posterior tibial cutdown: two case reports.  Recanalization of two occluded posterior tibial arteries was successfully achieved by utilizing a retrograde approach via a posterior tibial artery cutdown at the level of the ankle.  Both cases were previously unsuccessfully attempted by using an antegrade approach.  Thus, the choice of access vessel (arterial entry site) becomes a crucial determinant of angioplasty success.",13
"Antitumor activity of liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin in advanced breast cancer: phase II study.  Previous studies in animals have demonstrated liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin (LED) has substantially less cardiac toxicity than free doxorubicin but retains antitumor activity.  In a phase I clinical study of LED, the maximum tolerated dose was 90 mg/m2 and dose-limiting toxicity was considered to have been reached when granulocytopenia was produced.  We used LED to treat 20 patients with advanced, measurable breast cancer.  LED was given at doses of 60-75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks as an intravenous infusion.  Regression of disease was objectively measured in nine patients; in five of these patients, complete regression of the index lesion occurred.  The mean duration of the responses was 7 months.  Hematologic toxicity consisted of grade 1-2 leukopenia in some patients.  Gastrointestinal toxicity and mucositis were generally mild and tolerable.  Alopecia occurred in all patients and usually was complete.  Twelve patients received cumulative doses of LED of greater than 400 mg/m2 and were evaluated with radionuclide ventriculograms.  In eight patients, the cumulative dose was greater than 500 mg/m2, and five had endomyocardial biopsies.  Four of these biopsy results were Billingham grade 0, while one (cumulative LED dose, 750 mg/m2) showed grade 1 changes with mild myofibrillar loss and dilatation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum involving less than 5% of cardiac myocytes.  Two patients had decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction.  One of these patients had received a total dose of LED of 630 mg/m2 and had a decline of 13% in left ventricular ejection fraction, but had no clinical evidence of congestive heart failure and had a Billingham grade 0 endomyocardial biopsy.",3
"Gallbladder motility in cholesterol gallstone disease. Effect of ursodeoxycholic acid administration and gallstone dissolution   Gallbladder motility was evaluated by ultrasonography in 75 cholesterol gallstone patients and in 77 matched control subjects.  All 75 gallstone patients were candidates for oral bile acid therapy (radiolucent gallstones, less than 2 cm in diameter, in well-opacified gallbladder), and 38 of them were also studied during ursodeoxycholic acid administration.  An additional 20 gallstone patients were studied 1 year after confirmed gallstone dissolution with oral bile acids.  Gallstone patients showed significantly greater fasting and residual volumes, a decreased percent of gallbladder emptying, but a similar absolute emptying and emptying rate compared with the control subjects.  Greater fasting volumes and reduced percents of gallbladder emptying were also found in gallstone-free patients who achieved complete dissolution with oral bile acids.  After ursodeoxycholic acid administration, fasting gallbladder volumes were greater, and percents of gallbladder emptying were further decreased than in untreated gallstone patients.  In conclusion, greater fasting volumes, and not reduced gallbladder contractility, account for the defective gallbladder function in radiolucent (cholesterol-rich) gallstone patients.  This condition is likely to precede, and possibly to promote, gallstone formation because it persists after gallstone dissolution.  Ursodeoxycholic acid administration worsens the defect observed in gallstone patients.  This finding also suggests, although indirectly, that the expected normalization of cholesterol saturation during oral bile acid administration is not paralleled by an improvement in gallbladder function.",5
"Evaluation of active control trials in AIDS.  In settings in which effective standard treatment exists, active control trials provide an ethically appealing approach to evaluating experimental therapies by allowing all patients to be randomized either to a promising new regimen or to the standard as it would be routinely delivered in clinical practice.  This paper describes an appropriate statistical approach for analyzing the clinical efficacy of new treatments in such studies.  Confidence intervals for the relative efficacy of the new treatment vis-a-vis standard therapy are used to provide information required to determine whether the experimental treatment has an improved therapeutic index.  Desirable properties of this approach include the ability to implement standard group sequential guidelines for early trial termination, the ability to use valid surrogates for hard clinical outcomes, and the availability of straightforward formulas for sample size calculations.",19
"The absence of nephrotoxicity and differential nephrotoxicity between tobramycin and gentamicin.  We conducted a prospective, double-blind, randomized trial of gentamicin and tobramycin to evaluate differences in nephrotoxicity.  We evaluated levels of creatinine, creatinine clearance, beta 2-microglobulin, and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) as indicators of nephrotoxicity, and attempted to correlate them.  Forty patients met the criteria for evaluation; 14 were given tobramycin and the remaining 26 received gentamicin.  Significant nephrotoxicity, as defined by an increase in creatinine of 0.5 mg/dL, did not occur in either group.  Increases in beta 2-microglobulin values were seen in 67% of the patients in the tobramycin group, and 52% of those in the gentamicin group.  Elevations in NAG levels occurred in 54% of those in the tobramycin group and 52% of those in the gentamicin group.  Elevation of NAG and beta 2-microglobulin levels was congruent in only 40% of the cases.  We conclude that there was no significant difference in nephrotoxicity between gentamicin and tobramycin.  Elevations of NAG and beta 2-microglobulin occurred at rates similar to those reported in the literature, but they did not correlate with significant nephrotoxicity.",11
"Increased serum IgE and increased prevalence of eosinophilia in 9-year-old children of smoking parents.  We studied the relationship of serum IgE levels and eosinophil counts with passive smoking in 9-year-old, nonselected children from three Italian towns near Rome.  Male children of smoking parents had a significantly higher total count and percentage of eosinophils (p = 0.008) and higher IgE levels (p = 0.01) than male children of nonsmoking parents.  Prevalence of eosinophilia (defined as greater than or equal to 4% of total white blood cell count) was significantly correlated with the number of cigarettes smoked by parents among boys (p = 0.003) but not among girls (p = 0.20).  There was a significant trend (p = 0.008) for prevalence of eosinophilia to increase with increasing levels of serum IgE.  For any given level of serum IgE, the frequency of eosinophilia was higher among children of smoking parents than among children of nonsmoking parents.  When parental smoking was studied in a multivariable analysis and after controlling for the other variable, it was still significantly associated with eosinophilia in the children of these smoking parents but not with serum IgE levels.  We conclude that parental smoking is associated with a significant enhancement of the expression of the most important markers of allergic sensitization in the children of smoking parents.  This is particularly evident for boys and may explain, at least in part, the increased frequency of respiratory symptoms in children of smoking parents.",14
"Hypoxic events in the surgical intensive care unit.  An oxygen-monitoring protocol was established in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) at the Denver General Hospital in July 1988.  A 3-month surveillance audit ending March 1989 prospectively documented 100 consecutive hypoxic events in 51 of 241 (21%) SICU patients.  These episodes occurred during mechanical ventilation in 46 patients, during spontaneous ventilation in 15 patients with artificial airways, and the remaining 39 occurred in nonintubated patients.  Hypoxemia was recognized by pulse oximetry in 59, arterial blood gas analysis in 24, mixed venous oximetry in 15, and transcutaneous oxygen monitoring in 2.  These events were due to problems with the ventilator or airway in 42, recent interventions in 21, new pulmonary process in 19, progression of underlying disease in 11, and unknown causes in 7.  Two thirds resulted from mechanical problems amenable to simple intervention; there were two adverse outcomes.  In conclusion, acute hypoxia is a frequent potentially morbid SICU event.  Advances in continuous oxygen monitoring permit early identification and thereby may limit adverse outcomes, but should not prompt an expensive diagnostic work-up.",22
"HLA antigens and nailfold capillary microscopy studies in patients with insulin dependent and noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus and limited joint mobility.  We investigated the HLA status of patients with diabetes associated with limited joint mobility and microvascular complications.  An increased frequency of HLA-B8, DR3 and DR4 in patients with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) compared to controls and patients with noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) was confirmed.  HLA antigen DQw1 was detected less frequently in patients with IDDM and was negatively associated with limited joint mobility and retinopathy.  Limited joint mobility was significantly correlated with disease duration in IDDM, and was associated with neuropathy in both IDDM and NIDDM and with retinopathy in IDDM.  No correlation was found between DR3, DR4 and limited joint mobility or diabetic complications.  We also investigated the usefulness of nailfold capillary microscopy in a large group of patients with IDDM and NIDDM.  Although capillary enlargement and avascular areas were noted in a few patients, nailfold capillary microscopy was not felt to be a useful tool in the evaluation of diabetes.",17
"Parvovirus B19-induced perturbation of human megakaryocytopoiesis in vitro.  Parvovirus B19 infection leads to transient aplastic crises in individuals with chronic hemolytic anemias or immunodeficiency states.  An additional unexplained sequela of B19 infection is thrombocytopenia.  Because B19 is known to have a remarkable tropism for human erythropoietic elements, and is not known to replicate in nonerythroid cells, the etiology of this thrombocytopenia is uncertain.  We sought to define the pathobiology of B19-associated thrombocytopenia by examining the role of B19 on in vitro megakaryocytopoiesis.  B19 infection of normal human bone marrow cells significantly suppressed megakaryocyte (MK) colony formation compared with mock-infected cells.  No such inhibition was observed with a nonpathogenic human parvovirus, the adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV).  The B19-MK cell interaction was also studied at the molecular level.  Whereas low-density bone marrow cells containing erythroid precursor cells supported B19 DNA replication, no viral DNA replication was observed in B19-infected MK-enriched fractions as determined by the presence of viral DNA replicative intermediates on Southern blots.  However, analysis of total cytoplasmic RNA isolated from B19-infected MK fractions showed a low-level expression of the B19 genome as detected by quantitative RNA dot blots as well as by Northern analysis.  Furthermore, a frame-shift mutation in a recombinant AAV-B19 hybrid genome segment that encodes the viral nonstructural (NS1) protein significantly reduced the observed inhibition of MK colony formation.  These studies indicate tissue-tropism of B19 beyond the erythroid progenitor cell, and lend support to the hypothesis that B19 genome expression may be toxic to cell populations that are nonpermissive for viral DNA replication.",14
"Selective regulation of the activity of different hematopoietic regulatory proteins by transforming growth factor beta 1 in normal and leukemic myeloid cells.  The viability of normal bone marrow myeloid precursor cells induced by interleukin-6 (IL-6) or IL-1 alpha and the ability of IL-6 and IL-1 alpha to induce the formation of colonies of granulocytes, macrophages, or megakaryocytes in densely seeded bone marrow cultures was suppressed by transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1).  Induction of normal bone marrow colony formation by IL-3 was much less sensitive to TGF-beta 1, and there was little or no effect of TGF-beta 1 on colony formation induced by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF).  In different clones of myeloid leukemic cells, TGF-beta 1 suppressed differentiation induced with IL-6, IL-1 alpha, or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), but did not suppress differentiation induced with IL-3 or GM-CSF.  The effect of TGF-beta 1 on differentiation of the leukemic cells can be dissociated from its effect on cell growth.  TGF-beta 1 suppressed the production of IL-6 in normal bone marrow cells cultured with IL-1 alpha and the production of IL-6 and GM-CSF in leukemic cells cultured with IL-1 alpha or LPS.  The suppression of IL-6 production can explain the suppression by TGF-beta 1 of the effects of IL-1 alpha and LPS that are mediated by IL-6.  TGF-beta 1 also suppressed differentiation in clones of myeloid leukemic cells induced with differentiation factor/leukemia inhibitory factor and tumor necrosis factor.  In different leukemic clones TGF-beta 1 suppressed or enhanced induction of differentiation with dexamethasone.  The results show that TGF-beta 1 can selectively control the activity of different molecular regulators of normal and leukemic hematopoiesis.",19
"Prevalence of symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon in general practice.  OBJECTIVE--To investigate the prevalence of Raynaud's phenomenon in the populations of five general practices.  DESIGN--Two populations studied.  A questionnaire was given to all new patients attending five general practices over four weeks, and the same questionnaire was sent by post to a random sample of adults from two of the practices.  SETTING--General practices in inner London, Merseyside, and Cheshire.  SUBJECTS--1532 Patients who completed questionnaires (1119 who attended the surgeries (response rate unknown) and 413 respondents to the postal survey (response rate 69%)).  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Response to questionnaire on symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon: patients were regarded as having the disease if they had episodes of blanching of the fingers that were precipitated by cold and accompanied by sensory symptoms (pins and needles or numbness).  Subsequent interview and clinical appraisal of patients with the disease according to their responses to the questionnaire.  RESULTS--The prevalence of Raynaud's phenomenon was 11% (26/231) and 19% (34/182) respectively in men and women who completed the postal questionnaire and 16% (56/357) and 21% (157/762) respectively in those who completed the questionnaire when attending their general practice.  Thus the overall rates were slightly higher in women, but there was no effect of age even after adjustment of the rates for practice and method of survey.  CONCLUSION--The prevalence of Raynaud's phenomenon is high compared with the low number of patients who seek treatment for the disease.",13
"Ubiquitin immunoreactivity in kuru plaques in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.  Cerebellar kuru plaques in 2 cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease were studied immunohistochemically.  Similar to cerebellar senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease, many kuru plaques contained ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative small granular elements, presumably representing dystrophic neurites.  Our results suggest that similar mechanisms are involved in neuritic changes in cerebellar plaques in Creutzfeldt-Jakob and Alzheimer's diseases despite differences of amyloid proteins in the plaques.",9
"Antigen related to cell proliferation in malignant gliomas recognized by a human monoclonal antibody.  A human monoclonal antibody (CLN-IgG) was produced from a human-human hybridoma derived from lymphocytes of a patient with cervical carcinoma.  The reactivities of this antibody with various human glioma tissues and cultured glioma cells and the characterization of the antigen recognized by CLN-IgG on malignant glioma cells were analyzed and reported.  CLN-IgG reacted with various human glioma cells and glioma tissues, especially glioblastoma, but did not react with normal brain tissues or fetal brain tissues.  A large amount of antigen recognized by CLN-IgG was expressed on cell membranes of undifferentiated glioma cells and of glioma cells at the G2/M tumor growth phase in cycling cells.  Antigen recognized by CLN-IgG was detected in only one of seven samples of cyst fluid, and was not detected in 27 serum samples or 18 samples of cerebrospinal fluid from glioma patients.  CLN-IgG exhibited antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity against U-25 1 MG glioma cells and primary cultured cells of glioblastomas and anaplastic astrocytomas.  These data suggest that the antigen recognized by CLN-IgG might be related to cell proliferation in malignant gliomas.  Thus, CLN-IgG might be useful for immunotherapy or immunoimaging of malignant gliomas.",3
"Therapy for hypercholesterolemia.  For most patients, hypercholesterolemia can be effectively lowered with drug therapy but only after several issues have been considered.  First, drug therapy should never be considered without adequate dietary intervention.  Dietary therapy may be effective for many patients with mild to moderate elevations in cholesterol.  None of the drugs used to treat lipid disorders are benign agents.  There is still debate about the interpretations of recent studies, the ability to generalize from studies to the whole population, and the cost effectiveness of drug treatment.  Within the framework of the AHA and NCEP guidelines, an individualized approach to therapy is prudent.  This should be initiated with maximal patient education because drug therapy will be maintained for the long-term or for life.  The LDL and HDL levels, age, sex, other CHD risk factors, cost of treatment, patient awareness, and motivation must all be assessed when making treatment decisions.  When drug therapy is considered for patients with isolated hypercholesterolemia, bile acid sequestrants are the drugs of choice.",17
"Interleukin-1 in human skin: dysregulation in psoriasis.  Cytokine dysregulation is an attractive concept to explain many of the observed abnormalities in psoriasis.  IL-1, in particular, can potentiate immune cellular activation, activate fibroblasts, and increase endothelial cell adhesiveness to leukocytes.  Here, we review IL-1 regulation in normal and psoriatic skin in vivo in relation to normal skin and cultured keratinocytes.  Contrary to expectations, IL-1 functional activity in psoriatic lesions is reduced, not increased, relative to normal skin.  The reduction is attributable to the presence of IL-1 inhibitors, reduced IL-1 alpha levels, and an IL-1 beta that lacked function in T-cell assays.  IL-1 beta protein is actually significantly increased in psoriatic lesions, but the mechanism of its non-functionality remains unclear.  Unlike cultured keratinocytes, which accumulate large, inactive IL-1 beta precursors, both normal and psoriatic skin process IL-1 beta to a mature form.  Novel mechanisms of post-translational processing by epidermis in vivo may generate a novel form of IL-1 beta with unknown functions.  The marked abnormalities of IL-1 regulation in psoriatic skin suggest that this molecule may be important in normal skin homeostasis.",16
"Slow release carbamazepine in treatment of poorly controlled seizures.  Thirty three children with poorly controlled epilepsy, and six new patients, were treated with slow release carbamazepine.  Twelve of the former had a reduction in the number of seizures of more than half, and 10 had fewer side effects.  Three of the new patients stopped having seizures.  Variations in plasma concentrations between doses was significantly less when patients took the slow release preparation (22%) compared with the standard preparation (41%).  Slow release carbamazepine may improve the conditions of children whose seizures are poorly controlled.",9
"Failure of hepatitis B immunization in liver transplant recipients: results of a prospective trial.  Twenty patients with advanced liver disease, in need of transplantation, were given three injections of 20 micrograms and three injections of 40 micrograms hepatitis B vaccine to see if an antibody response could be obtained.  Only 20% of patients developed measurable anti-HBs.  One who failed to develop anti-HBs developed chronic hepatitis B after exposure to her infected sexual partner.  Type of liver disease in the native liver, age, sex, sexual preference, timing of immunization (before or after transplantation), and dosage of hepatitis B vaccine did not seem to explain the lack of immunologic response to hepatitis B vaccine.  It is presumed that immunosuppression, both from the underlying disease and from immunosuppressive medications, best explains our findings.  Liver transplantation patients infrequently benefit from hepatitis B vaccine.  It is possible that other vaccines given to prevent viral and bacterial illness may also fail to elicit immunologic response in such patients.",5
"Laparoscopic management of ovarian cysts.  One hundred two women with ovarian cysts were managed laparoscopically over a 13-year period.  Thirteen were treated with laparoscopic inspection followed by laparotomy, 6 with laparoscopic fine needle aspiration followed by laparotomy and 83 with laparoscopic fenestration and biopsy, with or without coagulation or removal of the cyst lining.  Satisfactory results were noted in patients treated completely with laparoscopy.  Only 1 of 56 functional, simple or paraovarian cysts recurred during the study period.  Two of the 18 ovarian endometriomas treated with fenestration and coagulation or removal of the lining recurred, whereas 8 of 9 such lesions recurred when treated with fenestration alone.  There were no surgical complications.",3
"Fluorescence assays to monitor membrane fusion: potential application in biliary lipid secretion and vesicle interactions.  Membrane fusion constitutes an essential, intermediate step in numerous cell biological processes, occurring for example during endocytosis, membrane recycling and exocytosis.  Also less desirable events such as the infection of cells by animal viruses are mediated by membrane fusion during which the viral envelope merges with a cellular membrane, causing the expulsion of the viral nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm of the cell as an initial step in virus replication.  Much of our current knowledge concerning the mechanism of membrane fusion has been derived from studies using simple artificial membranes, such as liposomes or phospholipid vesicles, as model systems.  A most essential feature of these studies has been the development of membrane fusion assays that register in a sensitive and continuous fashion the mixing of membranes or the aqueous volumes initially enclosed by these membranes.  Not only do these assays allow one to readily detect and quantify fusion, but they also provide the possibility to relate the kinetics of fusion to the rate by which certain molecular changes in membranes take place.  Obviously, this insight is of relevance for understanding the mechanism of membrane fusion.  The principles and applications of some representative assays that rely on the use of fluorescence spectroscopy will be discussed.  Assays that monitor membrane mixing are commonly based on the detection of changes in resonance energy transfer efficiency or the relief of fluorescence self-quenching of appropriate fluorescent lipid analogs.  Contents mixing assays rely on either the formation of a (aqueous-soluble) fluorescent complex or quenching of a fluorophore, encapsulated in one vesicle population, by a suitable quencher, entrapped in a second population.",5
"Anti-idiotype monoclonal antibody carrying the internal image of ganglioside GM3.  Murine anti-idiotype monoclonal antibodies were generated against a human IgM monoclonal antibody (L612) that recognizes ganglioside GM3 on human melanoma.  Hybridomas secreting antibodies that bound specifically to L612 were selected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using L612 and three negative control human IgMs, including monoclonal anti-GM2 and anti-GD2 antibodies, as well as purified serum IgM, as antigen sources.  GM3-binding inhibition and cell-binding inhibition assays were used to identify seven anti-idiotype monoclonal antibodies that recognized determinants located within the antigen-combining sites of L612.  To determine whether these anti-idiotype monoclonal antibodies possessed the internal image of the original antigen, we immunized syngeneic BALB/c mice with one of the anti-idiotype monoclonal antibodies, 4C10, coupled with keyhole limpet hemocyanin.  Sera from the immunized mice reacted strongly with an antigen-positive M12 melanoma cell line and with purified GM3.  Because L612 detects and kills melanoma tumor cells in vitro and in vivo in the presence of complement without affecting normal tissues, anti-idiotype monoclonal antibodies carrying the internal image of GM3 may be an effective tool for active specific immunotherapy in patients with melanoma.",3
"Systems architecture for quantification of dynamic myoelectric and kinematic activity of the human vocal tract.  This paper describes a systems architecture useful for scientific investigations that require the acquisition and analysis of multiple, time-synchronous signals in large volume.  The architecture has recently been developed by this group to enhance our capability to research and quantify central nervous system function in the production of normal and pathologic speech.  The architecture utilizes modern advances in desktop microcomputers and has been designed so that vocal motor control laboratories (or similar settings) with modest funding can more fully participate in comprehensive investigations of speech production.  Research experiments organized with this architecture may involve many more subjects and measures than previously possible without significant increases in time and personnel resources.  This paper will demonstrate the technique and practicality of this architecture as it is being used to successfully guide research to map hierarchic central nervous system regions of involvement in two speech disorders: spasmodic dysphonia and stuttering.  The architecture has broad usefulness to many areas of otolaryngology and health science.",7
"Multiple intracranial tumors of different cell types.  Multiple intracranial tumors of different cell types are rare.  We report nine patients with multiple intracranial tumors, who did not have a history of trauma, irradiation, or phacomatosis.  The clinical, radiological, and histopathological findings as well as indications for operations in patients with asymptomatic second tumors are discussed.",3
"Value of transesophageal echocardiography during repair of congenital heart defects.  Two-dimensional transesophageal color Doppler echocardiography was employed intraoperatively in 30 children undergoing repair of a variety of simple and complex cardiac malformations.  There were 16 female and 14 male patients, with a mean age of 9 +/- 3 years (range, 4 to 13 years) and a mean weight of 31 +/- 9 kg (range, 16 to 50 kg), 16 children weighing less than 30 kg.  A standard, commercially available transesophageal echocardiography probe (5 MHz, 64 elements) was used in all patients without complications.  Transesophageal echocardiography proved helpful in selecting the surgical approach, in assessing the adequacy of surgical repair, in detecting residual intracardiac shunts, and in allowing uninterrupted monitoring of ventricular performance throughout the procedure.  Our initial experience suggests that transesophageal echocardiography is a valuable tool to be used in children with congenital cardiac malformations, particularly in those requiring complex intracardiac procedures.  The amount of information obtained by the surgeon should favor the routine use of transesophageal echocardiography during open heart procedures and stimulate the development of probes to be safely used even in infants and newborns.",15
"Maximal oxygen uptake in severe aortic regurgitation: a different view of left ventricular function.  Respiratory gas exchange was used to assess left ventricular (LV) function in 22 patients with severe aortic regurgitation (19 men and three women, aged 18 and 70 years, mean 49 years).  Anaerobic threshold and symptom-limited maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) were measured during treadmill exercise, and the results were compared with conventional echocardiographic and radionuclide indices of LV systolic function.  The results were considered with respect to the patients' New York Heart Association functional class.  Both rest and exercise LV ejection fractions were variable, but the mean results were similar in all classes.  The echocardiographic indices of LV cavity dimensions, fractional shortening, radius/thickness ratio, and systolic wall stress also showed a wide range but with similar mean results in each class.  In contrast, VO2 max and anaerobic threshold showed a relationship to functional class.  VO2 max was 32.4 +/- 3.4 ml/kg/min in age-matched control subjects; in the patients it was 27.9 +/- 4.7 in class I, 24.7 +/- 5.7 in class II, and 14.2 +/- 2 in the combined class III/IV.  Results in patients in classes I and II were similar, but both groups were significantly different from control subjects (p less than 0.05) and from patients in class III/IV (p less than 0.01).  About half of the patients with moderate LV dysfunction (judged by reduced VO2 max) were asymptomatic, and LV function was impaired in 4 of 10 patients in class I.  Thus, unlike conventional indices of LV function, VO2 max appeared capable of distinguishing patients with moderate-to-severe LV dysfunction from those with little or no LV dysfunction.  Measurement of respiratory gas exchange appears to be a valid and useful supplementary means of assessing LV function in severe aortic regurgitation.  Further long-term evaluation is required.",13
"Results of a 25-year screening programme for neonatal hip instability.  From 1962 to 1986, 117,256 neonates were screened for congenital dislocation of the hip (CDH).  When the primary physical examination was performed by the junior paediatric staff there was a persistent late diagnosis rate of 0.5 per 1000 live births.  When the primary examination was undertaken by experienced orthopaedic personnel (1982 to 1984) the late diagnosis rate fell and fewer infants were splinted.",15
"Ten-year follow-up of survival and myocardial infarction in the randomized Coronary Artery Surgery Study   The Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) randomized 780 patients to an initial strategy of coronary surgery or medical therapy.  Of medically randomized patients, 6% had surgery within 6 months and a total of 40% had surgery by 10 years.  At 10 years, there was no difference in cumulative survival (medical, 79% vs.  surgical, 82%; NS) and no difference in percentage free of death and nonfatal myocardial infarction (medical, 69% vs.  surgical, 66%; NS).  Patients with an ejection fraction of less than 0.50 exhibited a better survival with initial surgery treatment (medical, 61% vs.  surgical, 79%; p = 0.01).  Conversely, patients with an ejection fraction greater than or equal to 0.50 exhibited a higher proportion free of death and myocardial infarction with initial medical therapy (medical, 75% vs.  surgical, 68%; p = 0.04) although long-term survival remained unaffected (medical, 84% vs.  surgical, 83%; p = 0.75).  There were no significant differences either in survival and freedom from nonfatal myocardial infarction, whether stratified on presence of heart failure, age, hypertension, or number of vessels diseased.  Thus, 10-year follow-up results confirm earlier reports from CASS that patients with left ventricular dysfunction exhibit long-term benefit from an initial strategy of surgical treatment.  Patients with mild stable angina and normal left ventricular function randomized to initial medical treatment (with an option for later surgery if symptoms progress) have survival equivalent to those patients randomized to initial surgery.",13
"Organ injury scaling, II: Pancreas, duodenum, small bowel, colon, and rectum.  The Organ Injury Scaling (O.I.S.) Committee of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (A.A.S.T.) has been charged to devise injury severity scores for individual organs to facilitate clinical research.  Our first report (1) addressed O.I.S.'s for the Spleen, Liver, and Kidney; the following are proposed O.I.S.'s for Pancreas (Table I), Duodenum (Table II), Small Bowel (Table III), Colon (Table IV), and Rectum (Table V).  The grading scheme is fundamentally an anatomic description, scaled from 1 to 5, representing the least to the most severe injury.  We emphasize that these O.I.S.'s represent an initial classification system which must undergo continued refinement as clinical experience dictates.",20
"Unconjugated bilirubin and cholesterol gallstone formation.  Cholesterol gallstones usually have small amounts of pigment at their centers and often have diffuse pigmentation or pigmented layers alternating with cholesterol layers and/or pigmented rims associated with calcium carbonate (eggshell calcification).  The pigments are primarily monomeric calcium salts of unconjugated bilirubin anions and/or an insoluble, black, network polymer of tetrapyrroles.  Bilirubin presumably can precipitate only if bile is supersaturated with calcium bilirubinates.  Among various in vitro model systems, the aqueous solubilities and pK'a values for unconjugated bilirubin differ greatly.  It is therefore not known whether normal bile is saturated with unconjugated bilirubin.  However, all systems indicate that unconjugated bilirubin is solubilized by binding to bile salt monomers and oligomers, as well as micelles; marked metastable supersaturation of unconjugated bilirubin can occur in the presence of bile salt micelles, and both pK'a values of unconjugated bilirubin are greater than 6.0, probably because of internal hydrogen-bonding of the--COOH groups.  Lecithin decreases equilibrium solubilization of unconjugated bilirubin crystals but enhances metastable supersaturation of unconjugated bilirubin.  Calcium ions form insoluble salts with unconjugated bilirubin monoanions and dianions but soluble complexes with bilirubin conjugates.  The solubility products of the calcium bilirubinate salts suggest that normal hepatic bile is not saturated with CaB or Ca(HB)2 but that gallbladder bile may be supersaturated with Ca(HB)2.",5
"Corticosteroids in primary tuberculosis with bronchial obstruction.  The usefulness of prednisolone in combination with the modern potent antituberculous drugs has been studied in 29 children with primary lung tuberculosis and hilar adenopathy causing bronchial obstruction.  These children were divided at random in two groups of 15 and 14 patients.  Both groups were treated similarly except that one group received prednisolone.  Both groups were very similar before the onset of treatment for most variables.  Tuberculous infection healed in both groups but the group on steroids improved earlier and had significantly fewer complications, both on radiography and bronchoscopy.  Only two of the patients on steroids still had progressive lesions: a very young baby probably because he developed two severe viral infections consecutively, and another infant of 7 months whose treatment was unreliable, as the parents were not very compliant.  Some patients initially not treated with prednisolone improved only after it was given.  Prednisolone treatment is not recommended when the reliability of the treatment cannot be guaranteed, as the hazard of harm would exceed the expected benefit.",7
"Characteristics and correlates of asthma in a university clinic population.  To contribute more comprehensive information about the characteristics of asthma, this article analyzed patients served by the University of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Asthma Program.  Their physicians rated one fifth of these patients as having ""severe"" asthma with the remainder about equally divided between ""moderate"" and ""mild"".  One in two first received a diagnosis of asthma ten or more years previously.  Common comorbidities were hypertension, obesity, rhinitis, bronchitis, sinusitis, and arthritis.  One half had visited an emergency room or been hospitalized for asthma in the past year.  Inhaled bronchodilators and continuous theophylline were the most commonly prescribed medications.  Side effects, especially tachycardia and insomnia, were common and almost exclusively associated with theophylline or corticosteroid therapy.  Spirometric assessment showed chronic airflow obstruction in those with more severe asthma.  Prevalence of respiratory symptoms, intensity of medication regimen, incidence of side effects, and health care utilization increased as asthma severity increased.",19
"In situ hybridisation with digoxigenin-labelled DNA probes for detection of viral genomes.  The applicability of a recently developed non-radioactive DNA labelling and detection method, which uses the digoxigenin (DIG) enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system, for the detection of viral infections in pathology specimens by in situ hybridisation, was examined.  Its efficacy was compared with that of biotin and radioisotope labelling methods.  Three cases of progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy, two of verruca vulgaris, and seven cases of laryngeal papilloma were studied.  The sensitivity of the DIG labelled probe was almost the same as that of a 35S-labelled probe in the dot-blot hybridisation test.  Using in situ hybridisation with 35S-labelled and DIG labelled probes, the levels of the hybridised signals detected were similar.  The biotin labelled probe was less sensitive, particularly in the cases of laryngeal papilloma.  The DIG labelling and detection method was highly sensitive and applicable to the detection of viral infection by ISH, and is preferable to a radiolabelled probe, especially when in situ hybridisation is done in the pathology laboratory.",1
"Elevated serum procollagen III aminopeptide levels in sarcoidosis.  Procollagen III aminopeptide (P-III-P), a peptide released during the conversion of type III procollagen to type III collagen, is considered a potential marker of fibroblast activity in a variety of pulmonary and extrapulmonary diseases.  The aim of the present article was to investigate the levels of P-III-P in serum samples (sP-III-P) from a large number of sarcoid patients, in particular looking at its relationship with other markers of disease activity and its presumed role as a marker of pulmonary fibrosis.  sP-III-P has been radioimmunoassayed in an overall series of 57 patients and the levels were higher (19.18 +/- 9.17 ng/ml) than in 25 age- and sex-matched controls (11.32 +/- 2.15 ng/ml; p less than 0.001).  The elevation was neither sex-related nor related to obvious liver sarcoid localization.  Although sP-III-P levels were slightly higher in patients with stage II, there was no significant difference in patients with stage I or III.  We found a positive relationship with serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (S-ACE) levels (p less than 0.04), but not with other markers of disease activity (67Ga uptake, bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL] lymphocyte percent, vital capacity, and lung diffusing capacity).  The relationship with S-ACE was confirmed in a longitudinal follow-up study, where sP-III-P strictly paralleled the S-ACE behavior.  Finally, the initial sP-III-P levels did not predict cases either with disease relapse or resistance to corticosteroid treatment.  We conclude that, in our study, sP-III-P levels failed to characterize sarcoid patients with radiologic fibrotic pattern (stage III), and, in addition, were unable to predict which patients would have a poor prognosis.  Rather, they reflect a metabolic activity of sarcoid granuloma cells.  Thus, the usefulness of sP-III-P in the treatment of patients with sarcoid may be considered similar to that of S-ACE.",14
"The effect of local deep microwave hyperthermia on experimental zymosan-induced arthritis in rabbits.  The effect of local deep microwave hyperthermia (LDMWH) on normal and Zymosan-induced arthritis has been evaluated in 12 rabbits (24 joints).  LDMWH, four treatments to each joint (twice weekly for a period of 2 wk), was generated by an antenna operating at 915 MHz for 60 min, reaching an intraarticular temperature of 42.5 +/- 0.5 degrees C.  A surface cooling system was used with the microwave apparatus.  Two weeks after the last treatment, all animals were sacrificed.  The application of LDMWH on normal joints induced a limited proliferation of the synovial lining cells with a minimal perivascular infiltration of mononuclear and neutrophil cells.  However, no histologic damage to the skin, muscles, bone, cartilage or bone marrow adjacent to the heated joints could be noted.  Induction of Zymosan arthritis (2 wk before LDMWH) was characterized by pannus formation and granulomatous reaction accompanied by fibrinoid deposits and disseminated necrotic foci in the synovial intima.  The LDMWH treatment on the examined arthritic joints brought about a reduction in the degree of granulomatous reaction concomitant with the appearance of some fibrocytes and fine collagen fibrils.  These findings suggest that LDMWH can be safely applied, even repeatedly, without morphologic evidence of damage to any normal mesenchymal tissue.  Moreover, it reduces the inflammatory process in experimentally induced synovitis.",4
"Histologic study of eustachian tube cartilage with and without congenital anomalies: a preliminary study.  We investigated histopathologically the development of the eustachian tube (ET) cartilage at a cellular level in individuals with and without congenital anomalies.  Fourteen specimens were obtained from 14 individuals ranging in age from 24 weeks' gestation to 3 years who had cleft palate or trisomy 21 (Down) syndrome; the 49 specimens in the nonanomaly (control) group were from 49 individuals ranging from 26 weeks' gestation to 85 years of age.  All temporal bone specimens included the ET and its accessory structures, and all were processed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histologic study in a routine manner.  The number of cartilage cells in the midcartilaginous portion of the ET was determined by light microscopy.  In all groups, cartilage cell density of the ET decreased with increasing age.  However, cell density tended to be higher at all ages for individuals with cleft palate and microtia versus controls, and tended to be lower at all ages for individuals with Down syndrome.",6
Relation between intraventricular pressure and volume in diastole.  The pressure-volume curves for 10 patients with various types of heart disease were studied throughout mid to late diastole when both pressure and volume were increasing.  The results were used to test a currently held theory that the form of this relation is exponential.  It was found that for the patients examined this hypothesis was not valid.,13
"Simulated left ventricular aneurysm and aneurysm repair in swine.  Patch reconstruction of left ventricular aneurysm may be superior to linear closure, but this hypothesis has not been tested experimentally.  Accordingly, six anesthetized domestic pigs were instrumented to measure regional left ventricular wall thickening, stroke volume, systolic left ventricular pressure, and myocardial oxygen consumption.  With total bypass and cardioplegia, a 6 by 8 cm Dacron patch was inserted into the anteroapical left ventricle.  Simulations were as follows: left ventricular aneurysm, patch open; patch reconstruction, 50% patch plication; standard repair, ventriculotomy edges approximated.  Global function, from stroke work (stroke volume x integral of left ventricular pressure)-left ventricular end-diastolic pressure curves, was depressed in all three simulations compared with control.  A tendency for stroke work to be greater for standard repair than for left ventricular aneurysm and patch reconstruction at higher preloads was not statistically significant.  Mechanical efficiency, from stroke work/myocardial oxygen consumption (joules per milliliter oxygen per beat), was 2.43 +/- 0.52 (mean +/- standard error of the mean) (control), 2.22 +/- 0.94 (standard repair), 1.27 +/- 0.39 (patch reconstruction), and 1.09 +/- 0.37 (left ventricular aneurysm) (no significant differences).  Regional work was calculated as regional left ventricular wall thickening x integral of left ventricular pressure.  The slope of the regional work-end-diastolic wall thickness relation decreased in the posterior wall 14.0 +/- 2.9 (control) versus 8.4 +/- 2.0 (left ventricular aneurysm), 6.9 +/- 1.4 (patch reconstruction), and 7.4 +/- 1.4 (standard repair) (p less than 0.05).  In the anterior wall, contractility did not change significantly (7.4 +/- 1.2, control; 7.8 +/- 2.7, left ventricular aneurysm; 5.0 +/- 0.4, patch reconstruction; and 5.3 +/- 0.4, standard repair).  Decreased end-diastolic wall thinning anteriorly suggested tethering.  These results in the normal left ventricle suggest that patch ventriculoplasty is of no greater benefit than linear repair.  Either repair may impede function of adjacent myocardium through restriction of regional diastolic lengthening.",13
"Developmental adaptations in cytosolic phosphate content and pH regulation in the sheep heart in vivo.  This study examines adaptations in myocardial cytosolic phosphate content and buffering capacity that occur in vivo as a function of development.  Phosphate metabolites were monitored in an open chest sheep preparation using a 31P magnetic resonance surface coil over the left ventricle.  Newborn lambs (aged 4-9 d, n = 5) underwent exchange transfusion with adult blood to reduce blood-borne 2,3-diphosphoglycerate contamination of the heart monophosphate and phosphomonoester resonances, thus allowing determination of these phosphate concentrations.  The blood-exchanged newborns and mature controls (aged 30-60 d, n = 5) were infused with 0.4 N hydrochloric acid to decrease pH from greater than 7.35 to less than 7.00.  Simultaneously, intracellular and extracellular pH were determined from the chemical shifts of the respective phosphate peaks and compared to arterial blood pH.  Findings were as follows: (a) diphosphoglycerate contribution to the cardiac spectrum was found to be negligible, (b) significant decreases in cytosolic phosphate (P less than 0.03) and phosphomonoester (P less than 0.01) content occurred with maturation, and (c) large decreases in extracellular pH (greater than 0.5 U) in both groups were similarly associated with only small changes in intracellular pH (less than 0.1 U).  Change in cytosolic phosphate content implies that alterations occur in the phosphorylation potential with resulting effects on regulation of myocardial respiration, and cardiac energetics.",17
"Extracellular collagenase, proteoglycanase and products of their activity, released in organ culture by intact dermal inflammatory lesions produced by sulfur mustard.  Peak (1 and 2 d) and healing (3, 6, and 10 d) inflammatory lesions were produced in rabbits by the topical application of the military vesicant, bis(2-chloroethyl)sulfide, commonly called sulfur mustard (SM).  SM produces an acute sterile dermal inflammatory reaction with little or no necrosis, except in the epidermis, which dies during the first day.  After an animal was killed, its lesions were excised intact, as full-thickness 1.0-cm2 explants.  They were then organ-cultured for 3 d in order to maintain the viability of both local and infiltrating cells.  The extracellular fluid in each lesion equilibrated with the culture fluid, which was collected daily and analyzed for collagenase and proteoglycanase activities.  These metalloproteinase activities were measured after we had i) destroyed the alpha-macroglobulin inhibitors with KSCN, ii) destroyed the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) by reduction and alkylation, and iii) activated the latent proteinase activity with aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA).  Hydroxyproline-containing peptides and glycosaminoglycans (GAG) released into the culture fluids were also measured as indicators of local collagenase and proteoglycanase activity within the inflammatory lesions.  In general, the levels of both the metalloproteinases and the products of their activity were higher in second- and third-day culture fluids than in first-day culture fluids, and higher in fluids from SM lesions than in those from normal skin.  The activated fibroblast was apparently the major cell type producing the collagenase and proteoglycanase.  The hydrolysis of collagen and ground substance occurs pericellularly.  An excess of inhibitors exists outside the pericellular region.  The daily change in culture fluids apparently decreased such inhibitors, so that by the second and third day of culture we could detect the changes in pericellular enzyme activity that were not detectable on the first day of culture.  As the inflammatory lesions healed, the extracellular enzyme products (hydroxyproline and GAG) increased more than the enzymes that produced these products.  With healing, a decrease occurs in the extravasation of all serum components, especially the large ones such as the alpha-macroglobulin inhibitors.  We propose that during healing, the decrease in these inhibitors allows the metalloproteinases to begin the remodeling process, and that during the peak phase of inflammation, these same inhibitors protect extracellular matrix against hydrolysis by such proteinases.",16
"Possible triggering of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in normal hearts by psychological stressors: a report of two cases.  Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was triggered by psychological stress in two patients, both of whom had normal echocardiograms and coronary angiography.  Neither patient was alcoholic or had ingested ethanol in relation to the onset of atrial fibrillation and both were free of metabolic derangements.  Possible mechanisms involved in the triggering of atrial fibrillation are discussed.",13
"Mycobacterium leprae-specific T cells from a tuberculoid leprosy patient suppress HLA-DR3-restricted T cell responses to an immunodominant epitope on 65-kDa hsp of mycobacteria.  The polar tuberculoid type (TT) of leprosy, characterized by high T cell reactivity to Mycobacterium leprae, is associated with HLA-DR3.  Surprisingly, DR3-restricted low T cell responsiveness to M.  leprae was found in HLA-DR3-positive TT leprosy patients.  This low responsiveness was specifically induced by M.  leprae but not by M.  tuberculosis and was seen only in patients and not in healthy controls.  We studied this patient-specific, M.  leprae-induced, DR3-restricted low T cell responsiveness in depth in one representative HLA-DR3-positive TT leprosy patient by using T cell clones.  From this patient two types of T cell clones were obtained: one type was cross-reactive with M.  tuberculosis and recognized an immunodominant epitope (amino acids 3 to 13) on the 65-kDa heat shock protein (hsp) the other type was M.  leprae specific and reacted to a protein other than the 65-kDa one.  To examine whether these M.  leprae-specific T cell clones were responsible for the DR3-restricted low responsiveness to M.  leprae, we tested them for the ability to suppress the proliferation of the DR3-restricted, 65-kDa, hsp-reactive clones.  The DR3-restricted, M.  leprae-specific T cells completely suppressed the proliferative responses of DR3-restricted, cross-reactive T cell clones to the 65-kDa hsp from the same patient as well as from other individuals.  Also, DR3-restricted responses to an irrelevant Ag were suppressed by the M.  leprae-specific T cell clones.  However, no suppression of non-DR3-restricted T cell responses was seen.  Although the mechanism must still be elucidated, this M.  leprae-induced, DR3-restricted immunosuppression may at least partly explain the observed DR3-associated low T cell responsiveness in TT leprosy patients.",0
"Initiating a chorionic villus sampling program. Relying on placental location as the primary determinant of the sampling route.  In initiating a chorionic villus sampling (CVS) protocol, we relied upon placental locations as the determinant in the choice of technique.  An anterior or fundal location prompted a transabdominal (TA) CVS, while the transcervical (TC) approach was reserved for posterior placentas.  A coaxial needle system was used for TA CVS (18-gauge, 15-cm guide needle and 20-gauge, 20-cm sampling needle), while TC CVS was accomplished with a 5.8-French, 27-cm polyethylene catheter.  Between July 1988 and February 1989 our initial 118 procedures were performed for 115 consecutive pregnancies using this protocol.  Testing indications and antenatal characteristics of the TA (n = 56) and TC (n = 63) groups were similar.  One procedure failure occurred in the TC group, and a single aspiration was sufficient in 59% of the cases (TA, 30/55; TC, 39/63).  In TC procedures an increased aggregate sample weight was observed as compared to TA cases (25.8 g vs.  16.9 g, respectively; P less than .001).  This difference was not attributable to an increased number of placental aspirations in TC cases.  One abnormal karyotype was observed (45X), and four pregnancy losses occurred (TC, 3; TA, 1).  Using placental location to determine the choice of CVS technique appears to be feasible and may be associated with a lower failure rate during a facility's initial experience (when compared to reliance upon one technique alone).  Trials comparing the safety of these two methods should consider placental location an independent variable before randomization.",12
"Experience with the use of coronary autoperfusion catheter during complicated angioplasty.  Between February and July of 1989, 22 patients underwent the use of the Stack autoperfusion catheter following acute occlusion or obstructive dissection during coronary angioplasty; in 20 cases conventional balloon was used in an attempt to correct the angiographic appearance followed by the use of Stack catheter when results were sub-optimal.  Only 1 patient (4.5%) required surgical revascularization.  Although our study is not prospective or randomized, our observations suggest a significant impact in decreasing the need for emergency surgical revascularization after complicated coronary angioplasty with the use of this approach.",13
"Reversal of colchicine-induced mitotic arrest in Chinese hamster cells with a colchicine-specific monoclonal antibody.  The ability of a high-affinity colchicine-binding monoclonal antibody to reverse the effects of colchicine on Chinese hamster ovary cells was investigated.  Using flow cytometry, a complete mitotic blockade was demonstrated after 16 hours with 2.5 x 10(-7) mol/l (molar) colchicine.  Colchicine-induced changes were reversible when equimolar antibody was added simultaneously with or up to 6 hours after colchicine.  With further delay in addition of antibody, a progressive irreversible increase in mitotic blockade and increase in mean cell size was observed.  Prolonged colchicine exposure, without antibody reversal, led to polyploidy and structural chromosome breakage.  Early antibody reversal restored cells to the diploid state, whereas delayed reversal resulted in a time-dependent increase in polyploidy.  Colchicine-induced polyploidy and chromosomal aberrations may be the basis for both colchicine toxicity and the time-dependent increase in irreversibility of colchicine effects.",22
"Untying the gordian knot: the genetics of Tourette syndrome.  A review of the current status of the genetics of Tourette syndrome is presented.  Over the course of the 104 years since Gilles de la Tourette described the syndrome that bears his name, a body of carefully collected, described, and analyzed data has produced a model of the genetics that implicates a single dominant gene that is variably penetrant in males and females.  Moreover, the locus of action of this gene is most likely in the dopaminergic system of the midbrain.  A systematic search for this gene using recombinant DNA techniques is under way.",9
"Insulin administration via liposomes.  Liposomes have been used in insulin therapy as a means to selectively target insulin to the liver, enhance oral absorption of insulin, and prolong insulin action.  Liposomes are an effective means of delivering insulin specifically to hepatocytes.  The usefulness of hepatically targeted liposomes in the treatment of diabetes is restricted due to the requirement that they be given intravenously, the dilute concentration of insulin present in liposomal preparations, and the cost associated with liposome production.  Encapsulating insulin in liposomes results in enhanced oral absorption of insulin.  The high doses of liposome-entrapped insulin required perorally, coupled with extreme variability in the glycemic response to peroral liposomes, limits the value of peroral liposomal insulin as a viable diabetic therapy.  Insulin action can be sustained via encapsulation of insulin in liposomes given subcutaneously.  Most insulin appears to remain at the injection site, and the presence of a lipid matrix for subcutaneous insulin delivery raises concerns over enhanced antigenicity of liposomal insulin given subcutaneously.  Viewed in the light of the limitations outlined above, the contribution of liposomal insulin to understanding and treatment of diabetes mellitus will probably be via use of hepatically targeted liposomes as a pharmacological probe to decipher the role of the liver in the metabolic complications associated with diabetes mellitus.",17
"Chronic nightly tidal peritoneal dialysis.  Nightly tidal peritoneal dialysis (NTPD) is a technique in which, after an initial fill of the peritoneal cavity, only a portion of dialysate is rapidly cycled.  Five anuric, stable, PD patients entered a 4 month study to determine the NTPD session length necessary for clinically adequate dialysis and creatinine clearance similar to those on four daily 2 L CAPD exchanges.  NTPD was performed using a modified PAC-X-2 cycler, with the drain phase regulated by a target volume.  One patient completed 3.5 months of study, one 4 months, three 6 months, and one patient each continued on NTPD for 13, 14, and 32 months.  The mean NTPD session time was 9 hr 24 min (range 8 hr 35 min to 9 hr 55 min) at the end of 4 months.  All patients had clinically adequate dialysis.  Three patients preferred NTPD over CAPD, particularly because of an empty abdomen during the daytime.  One patient required an increase in NTPD time, and an addition of one daytime exchange, because of low creatinine clearance.  In conclusion, NTPD provides weekly creatinine clearances comparable to CAPD, with an acceptable duration of nightly dialysis sessions in most anuric patients.  A new PD machine providing inexpensive dialysis solution in large quantities, as well as safe and false alarm free dialysis sessions, is needed for practical NTPD implementation.",11
"Itraconazole treatment of phaeohyphomycosis.  Nineteen patients with phaeohyphomycosis were treated with itraconazole.  Of these, 17 were assessable for clinical outcome.  Of these, two had received no prior therapy, five had failed amphotericin B therapy, four had failed ketoconazole or miconazole therapy, and five had failed both amphotericin B and azole therapy.  One patient had received only prior surgical intervention.  Fungi of seven different genera caused disease of the skin in nine patients, soft tissue in nine, sinuses in eight, bone in five, joints in two, and lungs in two.  Itraconazole was given in dosages ranging from 50 to 600 mg/day for 1 to 48 months.  Clinical improvement or remission occurred in nine patients.  Two patients have had stabilization of disease.  Six patients failed treatment, one had a relapse after initially successful treatment.  Itraconazole appears to be highly effective in some patients with phaeohyphomycosis, including patients refractory to other antifungal agents.",0
"Human neutrophil cytochrome b light chain (p22-phox). Gene structure, chromosomal location, and mutations in cytochrome-negative autosomal recessive chronic granulomatous disease.  A membrane-bound cytochrome b, a heterodimer formed by a 91-kD glycoprotein (heavy chain) and a 22-kD polypeptide (light chain), is an essential component of the phagocyte NADPH-oxidase responsible for superoxide generation.  Cytochrome b is absent in two subgroups of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), an inherited disorder characterized by the lack of oxidase activity.  Mutations in the cytochrome heavy chain gene, encoded by the CYBB locus in Xp21.1, result in the X-linked form of CGD.  A rare subgroup of autosomal recessive CGD also lacks cytochrome b (A- CGD), but the genetic defect has not previously been identified.  In order to search for possible mutations in the cytochrome light chain locus, CYBA, the structure of this gene was characterized.  The CYBA locus was localized to 16q24, and the approximately 600-bp open reading frame determined to be encoded by six exons that span approximately 8.5 kb.  Three unrelated patients with A- CGD were studied for evidence of mutations in the light chain gene.  One patient, whose parents were first cousins, was homozygous for a large deletion that removed all but the extreme 5' coding sequence of the gene.  The other two patients had a grossly normal light chain transcript on Northern blot of mononuclear cell RNA.  The light chain transcript was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced.  One patient was a compound heterozygote for two alleles containing point mutations in the open reading frame that predict a frame shift and a nonconservative amino acid replacement, respectively.  The second patient, whose parents were second cousins, was homozygous for a different single-base substitution resulting in another nonconservative amino acid change.  These results indicate that A- CGD can results from defects in the gene encoding the 22-kD light chain of the phagocyte cytochrome b.",14
"Expression of placental alkaline phosphatase in gastric and colorectal cancers. An immunohistochemical study using the prepared monoclonal antibody.  The authors developed monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) against human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP).  Four specific MoAb reacting only with PLAP and two nonspecific MoAb reacting equally with isozymes of alkaline phosphatase (hepatic, intestinal, and placental) were obtained.  Immunohistochemical staining with the specific MoAb showed that the cell membrane and cytoplasm of cancer cells were stained in gastric and colorectal carcinoma.  The incidence of PLAP positivity was 23% (25 of 107) of all gastric carcinomas.  Among gastric carcinomas, the 42% (13 of 31) positivity of highly differentiated carcinoma (papillary adenocarcinoma and well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma) was a significantly higher rate than that found in poorly differentiated carcinoma (poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and signet-ring cell carcinoma, five of 41, 12%).  The incidence of PLAP positivity was 11% (four of 35) in colorectal carcinoma.  In contrast, gastric adenoma, intestinal metaplasia, and noncancerous tissue adjacent to cancer did not show staining.  These results indicated that expression of PLAP was apt to occur in more highly differentiated gastric carcinoma and was highly specific for carcinoma in the gastrointestinal tract, although its incidence was not high.",3
"Management of asymptomatic chronic aortic regurgitation with left ventricular dysfunction: a decision analysis   STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the optimal strategy for the timing of aortic valve replacement in patients with chronic, severe aortic regurgitation with left ventricular dysfunction.  DESIGN: Decision analysis comparing early surgery (timed at the onset of left ventricular dysfunction) with delayed surgery (timed at the onset of symptoms) using data from the literature and expert opinion for variables in a representative case scenario (40-year-old man with bicuspid aortic valve disease).  SETTING: Tertiary care center doing valve replacement surgery.  MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The early-surgery approach was preferred based on quality-adjusted life years.  Sensitivity analysis showed that the result was not affected by the following variables within their derived ranges: rate of symptom development after onset of left ventricular dysfunction for the delayed-surgery approach, perioperative mortality for both approaches, and occurrence of major nonfatal stroke or congestive heart failure for both approaches.  Although the decision was sensitive to the yearly postoperative mortality rates, the delayed-surgery operative mortality rate had to be almost as low as the early-surgery rate to change the preference to the delayed-surgery approach.  The preference could also change if survival were much more important to the patient in the first five years than after five years or if the patient disliked living on anticoagulants enough to value a year on anticoagulants as worth only 80% of a year not on anticoagulants.  CONCLUSION: This decision analysis provides quantitative support for the impression that patients similar to the case scenario do better with surgery timed at the onset of ventricular dysfunction than with surgery delayed until symptoms develop.  It thus supports the practice of following these patients noninvasively in order to time surgery.",13
"Balloon rupture due to lesion morphology during coronary angioplasty.  We report a case of coronary angioplasty of a left anterior descending artery lesion that was complicated by the rupture of three successive balloon catheters.  Each rupture occurred as a pinhole jet of contrast into a diagonal side branch, causing subintimal staining.  This case demonstrates that balloon rupture may result from lesion morphology.",13
"Electrocorticographic confirmation of focal positron emission tomographic abnormalities in children with intractable epilepsy.  The relationship between focal disturbances of glucose utilization demonstrated by positron emission tomography (PET) and electrophysiologic abnormalities defined by intraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) was studied in eight children (aged 13 months to 12 years) who underwent cortical resection because of intractable seizures.  None of the children had pure temporal lobe epilepsy.  Computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were normal in four of the eight children.  The scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) showed lateralized interictal epileptiform abnormalities in all eight and lateralized ictal onset in five of eight.  In seven children, interictal PET showed focal hypometabolism; the eighth child had focal, ictal hypermetabolism.  ECoG at the time of surgery showed epileptiform spiking, slowing, and/or suppression of normal background activity that in every case corresponded to the focus on PET scan.  The ECoG findings support the notion that in children with epilepsy focal metabolic abnormalities on PET correspond to electrophysiologically abnormal areas of cortex, which are presumably also the epileptogenic regions.  Such areas can appear normal on anatomic imaging studies (CT and MRI).  When ictal scalp EEG data are ambiguous or contradictory, PET provides a less invasive means than chronic grid or depth electrode recording for evaluating whether a localized epileptogenic area exists.",9
"Molecular biology of circulatory shock. Part III. Human hepatoblastoma (HepG2) cells demonstrate two patterns of shock-induced gene expression that are independent, exclusive, and prioritized.  During shock and resuscitation, parenchymal cells of solid organs are exposed to a rapidly changing microenvironment, which may include a reduced oxygen tension and an increased concentration of certain cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1.  In vivo experiments that testedl iver biopsied from pigs undergoing cardiogenic shock and resuscitation demonstrated several patterns of gene expression.  To study the independent and additive influences of hypoxia and of cytokines in vitro, human hepatoblastoma (HepG2) cells were perturbed by hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R), by heat shock, and by the cytokines interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha alone and in combination.  H/R induces new patterns of protein synthesis and secretion that are indistinguishable from those induced by heat shock and independent of the acute-phase response mediated by the cytokines.  The H/R (heat-shock) response has priority over and will extinguish gene expression supported by the cytokines.  This previously unrecognized hierarchy of stress gene expression could well form the molecular basis of shock-related cell and organ failure.",22
"In vitro evaluation of nicotinamide riboside analogs against Haemophilus influenzae.  Exogenous NAD, nicotinamide mononucleotide, or nicotinamide riboside is required for the growth of Haemophilus influenzae.  These compounds have been defined as the V-factor growth requirement.  We have previously shown that the internalization of nicotinamide riboside is energy dependent and carrier mediated with saturation kinetics.  Thionicotinamide riboside, 3-pyridinealdehyde riboside, 3-acetylpyridine riboside, and 3-aminopyridine riboside were prepared from their corresponding NAD analogs.  These compounds and several other nicotinamide riboside analogs were evaluated for their ability to support the growth of H.  influenzae and for their ability to block the uptake of [carbonyl-14C]nicotinamide riboside by H.  influenzae.  3-Aminopyridine riboside blocked the uptake of [carbonyl-14C]nicotinamide riboside and inhibited the growth of H.  influenzae when NAD, nicotinamide mononucleotide, or nicotinamide riboside served as the V factor.  The antibacterial activity of 3-aminopyridine riboside was found to be specific for H.  influenzae but had no effect on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli.  In additional experiments by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, it was determined that whole cells of H.  influenzae degrade 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide to 3-aminopyridine riboside, which is then internalized.  Inside the cell, 3-aminopyridine riboside has the ability to interfere with the growth of H.  influenzae by an undetermined mechanism.",0
"Plaque morphology and pathologic changes in arteries from patients dying after coronary balloon angioplasty   Morphologic correlates of pathologic success or failure were studied at autopsy in 28 patients with 40 coronary arteries that had been subjected to balloon angioplasty.  The presence of the following histologic features was evaluated: plaque concentricity or eccentricity, calcification, fibrous or fibropultaceous plaque, medial disruption, luminal thrombus and inflammation.  Angioplasty was considered successful (residual cross-sectional luminal area greater than 25%) on pathologic examination in 14 arteries and unsuccessful in 26 arteries.  Eccentric plaques were more likely to be successfully dilated than were concentric lesions (p less than 0.05).  Six (50%) of 12 fibropultaceous plaques were successfully dilated compared with only 8 (29%) of 28 fibrous plaques.  Moderate to severe calcification did not preclude morphologic success.  Medial stretching or dissection, or both, was more often associated with a successful result.  Thus, plaque morphology may be an important determinant of pathologic outcome after coronary angioplasty.",13
"Reconstruction of patellar tendon rupture after total knee arthroplasty with an extensor mechanism allograft.  Although patellar tendon rupture after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a rare complication, the consistently poor outcome of conventional tendon repair has convinced some to abandon such reconstruction in favor of a prospective protocol using an allograft distal extensor mechanism.  The graft consists of a quadriceps tendon, a patella with a cemented prosthesis, a patellar tendon, and a tibial tubercle.  Since December 1985, 13 knees in 12 patients were reconstructed using this method.  Ten knees were followed for six to 51 months; five of these knees were followed for more than 24 months.  Knee extension power and improved function were ultimately attained in all cases, although minimal extensor lags were present in three cases.  Preoperative motion returned in all but one knee.  Healing of the allograft to the host tissue was attained primarily at all of the tibial junctions.  Two graft complications occurred, both in the first three months after surgery: one quadriceps junction treated by resuture failed at the one-month mark, and the other graft had to be revised for extensor weakness from rupture of the graft at the patella-patellar tendon junction, which was attributed to surgical damage to the tendon.  After completion of healing to the host and rehabilitation of the knee joint, no grafts in the series failed during the course of normal daily activities.  One patient fractured the allograft patella in a severe fall.  The long-term durability of this construct needs to be studied further.",22
"Hemodynamic influence of LVAD on right ventricular failure.  Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) pumping has hemodynamic and anatomic influences on right ventricular performance.  A total artificial heart (TAH) model was employed to better understand the hemodynamic influence of an LVAD on the failing right ventricle.  Biventricular failure was simulated by reducing both ventricular drive pressures of the TAH.  After getting hemodynamic data, LVAD pumping in the case of right ventricular failure was simulated by increasing just the left ventricular drive pressure.  In the LVAD-simulating condition, cardiac output increased and right atrial pressure decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) compared with the biventricular failure condition, whereas right ventricular function and minute work were the same in these two conditions.  Even though changes were accompanied by adaptive increases in pulmonary resistance, substantially lower pulmonary artery and left atrial pressures resulted in the LVAD-simulating condition.  From a hemodynamic perspective, these results indicate that an LVAD can increase right ventricular volume work by decreasing right ventricular pressure work, whereas right ventricular net pressure-volume work is unchanged and right ventricular failure is not worsened.",13
"Accuracy in early prediction of prognosis of patients with septic shock by analysis of simple indices: prospective study.  In 26 consecutive septic shock patients, we analyzed the clinical, hemodynamic, and metabolic data before and during volume infusion to test their circulatory reserve in response to fluid repletion.  These patients were investigated to identify early variables that could predict outcome.  There were 15 survivors (group A) and 11 nonsurvivors (group B).  As a mean, group A patients were hemodynamically evaluated 2.3 h after onset of the sepsis syndrome, whereas group B patients underwent cardiac catheterization after a 12-h interval.  At the initial evaluation, both groups demonstrated similarly decreased mean arterial pressure, mean heart rate, and mean cardiac filling pressure.  Only group A patients evidenced elevated cardiac index (CI) (greater than 4 L/min.m2) associated with low systemic vascular resistance index (less than 7400 dyne.sec/cm5.m2), which is generally recognized as hyperdynamic cardiac state.  However, none of the initial cardiovascular variables could serve as a predictor for survival.  Fluid challenge increased left ventricular preload from 6 to 12.4 and from 7.8 to 12.7 mm Hg in group A and group B, respectively.  The increases were associated with significant increases in CI from 4.4 to 6.9 and from 3 to 3.8 L/min.m2.  However, at the end of fluid challenge, only group A patients exhibited normal cardiac response, as evidenced by the change in left ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI) for a given increase in the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (WP) that was referred to as left cardiac preload.",0
"Beneficial effects of fetal liver tissue on fetal pancreatic transplantation.  Recently, composite grafts of hepatocytes and islets have been shown to improve the survival of hepatocytes.  The possibility of a reciprocal effect of hepatocytes on islet function was investigated.  Diabetic Lewis rats were isografted with (1) fetal pancreas and fetal liver (FP/FL), (2) fetal pancreas alone (FP), and (3) fetal pancreas and fetal spleen (FP/FS).  Grafts were transplanted to the small bowel subserosa.  All (6/6) FP/FL recipients were cured (glucose less than 250 mg/dl for greater than 30 days), whereas only 72% (13/18) of FP alone and 60% (3/5) of FP/FS recipients were cured.  The amount of time to normoglycemia for FP/FS recipients was less (26 +/- 15 days) compared with FP (50 +/- 29 days) or FP/FS recipients (71 +/- 40 days).  Mean glucose levels at 6 weeks were 166 +/- 78 mg/dl, 237 +/- 97 mg/dl, and 355 +/- 81 mg/dl in cured FP/FL, FP, and FP/FS recipients, respectively.  Glucose tolerance test results were not significantly different from those of nondiabetic control rats.  In contrast to FP alone, FP/FL recipients had well-granulated hyperplastic islets and hepatocytes on histologic examination.  When new isograft recipients were treated with cyclosporine, all FP recipients remained hyperglycemic; however, 75% (6/8) of FP/FL recipients were cured.  In conclusion, FL in a composite graft with FP resulted in better engraftment, earlier isograft function, and protection from cyclosporine islet toxicity.",17
"Use of biological glue to control pulmonary air leaks.  Biological glue is a natural adhesive generated by the interaction between fibrinogen (pre-glue) and thrombin to produce fibrin.  The pre-glue is prepared from a single donor (to avoid the problems of pooled plasma) and stored as cryoprecipitate.  Before being used it is thawed, dissolved in saline, and activated into an adhesive by the addition of topical thrombin.  Biological glue was used prophylactically to prevent air leaks from bronchial suture lines and raw lung surfaces after pulmonary resections in six patients.  In addition two new methods of using biological glue have been developed for the control of persisting air leaks.  In selective intrabronchial tamponade the glue is instilled into the bronchial tree through a flexible bronchoscope, and in therapeutic pleurodesis it is instilled into the pleural cavity through a chest drainage tube.  The air leaks were resolved in all cases.  Seven procedures using selective intrabronchial tamponade were carried out in six patients.  Four were immediately successful but three were not and required further interventions.  Therapeutic pleurodesis alone was successfully carried out in one patient and as an adjunct to selective intrabronchial tamponade on two occasions.  A thoracotomy was eventually needed in one of the seven patients.",7
"Quality of life among hypertensive patients with a diuretic background who are taking atenolol and enalapril.  The cardioselective beta-blocker atenolol and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril were compared for efficacy, safety, and quality-of-life factors in 30 patients with hypertension whose hypertension was inadequately controlled with diuretic alone.  Atenolol (50 to 100 mg once a day) and enalapril (2.5 to 40 mg once a day), combined with hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg once a day), had similar levels of efficacy and safety.  A comprehensive battery of psychologic assessments for quality of life was administered, including measures of anxiety, depression, psychiatric symptoms, memory, and psychomotor function.  These five conceptually based clusters were first analyzed by multivariate analysis of variance procedures, followed by univariate analyses of the individual variables composing each domain.  In general, neither atenolol nor enalapril was associated with major changes in psychologic functioning.  The only data cluster with a statistically significant change was memory function, primarily as a result of lower scores of the digit span (backward) test, for atenolol relative to enalapril.  These preliminary findings suggest that atenolol and enalapril have comparable degrees of efficacy and safety, with no major disparities in quality-of-life effects, for hypertensive patients with a history of taking diuretics and this sort of quality-of-life assessment can be performed during trials of antihypertensive drugs.",13
"Comparison of cilofungin and amphotericin B for therapy of murine candidiasis.  We compared the efficacies of cilofungin and amphotericin B treatment in a murine model of disseminated candidiasis.  Three different dosages of each drug plus controls were evaluated.  Statistically improved survival was noted only among mice treated with 1 mg of amphotericin B per kg of body weight (P less than 0.05).  While all amphotericin B regimens and the two lower-dosage cilofungin regimens significantly reduced yeast cell counts in kidneys compared with the controls, the amphotericin B-treated mice had a significantly higher percentage of sterile kidneys following therapy compared with those treated with cilofungin (P = 0.0001).",0
"Esophageal motility in an adult with a congenital H-type tracheoesophageal fistula.  Congenital H-type tracheoesophageal fistulas (TEF) are rare.  Long-standing respiratory symptoms are the most common presenting complaints.  Patients with these fistulas have a congenital esophageal motor abnormality characterized by uncoordinated, low-amplitude peristalsis of the esophageal body; both low and normal lower esophageal sphincter pressures have been described.  These findings persist despite fistula repair.  A case history of an adult patient with congenital TEF is presented and the literature is reviewed.  This patient is unusual in that esophageal symptoms (dysphagia) were more prominent than the usual respiratory symptoms.",5
"The radial forearm flap for reconstruction of the upper extremity.  The radial forearm flap, owing to its good-caliber arteries of long length and equally well distributed venous system, has proved very reliable.  It has not only earned its place and recognition in reconstructive hand surgery, but also has emerged as a workhorse for the microvascular surgeon.  We have used 14 radial forearm flaps for upper extremity reconstruction, and we present herein our experience.  The technique of extracorporeal tissue transfer, which has been published elsewhere, was used in two patients and is detailed.  Four representative patients are presented.",20
"Diminished incidence of severe rheumatoid arthritis associated with oral contraceptive use.  It has been suggested that the negative association between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and oral contraceptive (OC) use might be limited to the more severe forms of RA.  To investigate this further, we studied 121 consecutive female patients with definite RA, 52 female patients with probable RA, and 378 female controls.  All patients had RA symptoms of recent onset.  After a mean followup period of 6 years, patients with definite RA were classified as having either a severe disease course (n = 76) or a mild disease course (n = 45).  The negative association between OC use prior to the onset of RA symptoms and the development of RA was limited to those patients with definite RA who had a severe disease course.  We therefore conclude that OC use prior to the onset of RA symptoms is only associated with a reduction in the incidence of severe RA.  This may explain the divergent results of previous studies.",16
"A rat femoral artery model for vasospasm.  A new animal model for vasospasm using rat femoral artery has been developed.  Whole blood, washed erythrocytes, or leukocytes in platelet-rich plasma were selectively applied to the adventitial surface of the femoral artery for 7 days in 15 rats, after which the vessels were perfusion-fixed and examined by light and transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry.  As compared with matched control arteries, there was a prominent reduction in luminal cross-sectional area after 7 days in vessels exposed to whole blood or washed erythrocytes, but not in those exposed to leukocytes in platelet-rich plasma.  In arteries with luminal narrowing, light and transmission electron microscopy demonstrated marked morphological changes throughout the vessel wall similar to those seen in cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Immunohistochemistry disclosed a prominent loss of immunoreactive actin in smooth muscle cells of arteries exposed to whole blood or erythrocytes.  To assess the time course of arterial narrowing in this model, whole blood was selectively applied to the adventitial surface of femoral arteries in 23 rats for periods from 2 to 20 days.  As compared with control arteries, arterial narrowing was variably present at 2 days, progressively increased by 5 days, was maximal at 7 to 10 days, and returned to near control levels by 20 days.  The presence and severity of ultrastructural changes in vessel wall corresponded to the degree of arterial narrowing over time.  These results suggest that chronic narrowing in rat femoral artery exposed to periadventitial blood is analogous to that observed in cerebral arterial vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage.  This new model represents a simple and reliable means to investigate pathogenic mechanisms and potential therapies for vasospasm.",21
"Surgical pocket reduction.  It is not possible within the scope of this paper to describe in any detail each of the aforementioned procedures.  These can be found in the various textbooks and journals on clinical periodontology.  Instead, the objectives of treatment, the spectrum of techniques available, and the rationale for their use have been described.  Periodontal surgery should be performed only under certain conditions: the patient must be physically and mentally competent to undergo any type of surgery, and should understand and agree to the procedure and to postoperative management.  Finally, periodontal surgery should only be considered when nonsurgical therapy will not accomplish the desired result.  When periodontal surgery for pocket elimination is performed for selected defects that have been properly evaluated after a debridement and healing period, and is executed with technical competence and proper postoperative care, it can preserve the dentition affected by periodontal disease.",6
"Relation between beta-adrenergic blocker use, various correlates of left ventricular function and the chance of developing congestive heart failure. The Multicenter Diltiazem Post-Infarction Research Group.  This study examined the relations among beta-adrenergic blocker use, various correlates of left ventricular function and the chance of developing congestive heart failure in patients after myocardial infarction.  The study was performed with the placebo group of the Multicenter Diltiazem Post-Infarction Trial.  Ejection fraction data were available in 1,084 patients; of these, 557 were receiving a beta-blocker and 527 were not.  In addition to ejection fraction, other correlates of left ventricular function included the presence or absence of pulmonary rales, chest X-ray film evidence of pulmonary congestion and the presence of an S3 gallop.  Beta-blocker use was less frequent in patients with an ejection fraction less than 30%, rales, an S3 gallop and pulmonary congestion on chest X-ray film.  Twenty-one percent of patients with an ejection fraction less than 30%, 42% of patients with rales, 28% of patients with an S3 gallop and 28% of patients with pulmonary congestion were receiving beta-blocker therapy.  For every correlate of left ventricular function, the chance of developing congestive heart failure was greater in patients with diminished left ventricular function than in those without.  For each level of left ventricular function, the chance of developing congestive heart failure requiring treatment was greater in patients not taking a beta-blocker.",13
"Limited precision of lumbar spine dual-photon absorptiometry by variations in the soft-tissue background.  The estimation error due to variations in soft-tissue baseline in lumbar bone mineral content (BMC) measured by dual-photon absorptiometry (DPA) was calculated with a new method of automatic baseline subtraction.  In water phantom measurements, the s.d.  of the soft-tissue (ST) baseline matched closely (r = 0.98) to the random error, calculated using 44 keV and 100 keV count rates and the directly determined baseline variations.  In 21 volunteers and in 70 patients with osteoporosis, the ST variations were larger than the expected random error, revealing a source of error related to the inhomogeneity of soft tissue.  The estimation error in BMC caused by ST variations was 0.7% in healthy subjects (mean BMC 40.5 gHA) and 1.5% in patients (mean BMC = 26.4 gHA).  These results indicate that ST-related errors are an important limit to the precision of lumbar DPA measurements.",4
"A method of pharmacoepidemiologic analysis that uses computerized Medicaid.  A method of pharmacoepidemiologic data analysis that utilizes computerized Medicaid data is presented.  A cohort design in which Medicaid enrollees receiving drugs that are normally used to treat similar underlying conditions is described.  A period of time in which Medicaid service transactions are evident is required before an individual is eligible for selection into a cohort.  Selection of study subjects and descriptions of cohorts are based on Medicaid service histories occurring during the preliminary, prerequisite period.  Time at risk is considered to begin after a prescription for a study drug is dispensed and continues until either a refill is dispensed, a prescription for an alternative drug within the same therapeutic class is dispensed, or a predetermined number of days has passed.  Subjects are followed forward in time and relevant health care transactions that are suggestive of suspected adverse drug reactions are noted.  Incidence densities associated with sequentially ranked prescriptions within sequential courses of therapy are compared.  Methods to increase the accuracy of case ascertainment are briefly discussed.  Separate validation studies may be used to evaluate the validity of computerized case ascertainment methods and to compensate for misclassification of outcome.  The proposed method is intended to provide timely estimates of risk for selected outcomes.  For outcomes that cannot be accurately ascertained from computerized data, this method may be useful in determining the feasibility of more customized studies.",19
